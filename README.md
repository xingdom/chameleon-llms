# Chameleon LLMs - Artifacts

This repository contains the experiment artifacts for our paper _Chameleon LLMs: User Personas Influence Chatbot Personality Shifts_. Through our work, we explored the ways in which a chatbot's perceived personality shifts based on the user it's interacting with.

## Software

Within software, you'll find the code for all our experiments, consistency work, and analysis work. We used GPT-4o mini as the base model for everything, including the simulated user. Note that some file paths may be broken due to post-work repo reorganization.

## Data

Within data, you'll find all our raw experiment and analysis outputs, including simulated conversations and diagram plots like our heatmaps.
