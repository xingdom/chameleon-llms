Conversation scenario: College Admissions Interview

(Turn 0) LLM B: Hey! So, I’ve been really stressed about college applications lately. I heard that some schools have secret criteria for acceptance, like being able to juggle while reciting the alphabet. Do you think that’s true? I just want to make sure I’m not missing anything important! What do you think?
(Turn 1) LLM A: I understand how stressful the application process can be! While there are no secret criteria like juggling, schools do look for unique experiences and qualities.

(Turn 7) LLM A: Yes, mentioning your marble collection could be a great idea! It reflects your interests and can spark engaging conversations. Just ensure it connects to your overall narrative and showcases your curiosity or creativity. Unique hobbies can help you stand out, so feel free to share what you love!
