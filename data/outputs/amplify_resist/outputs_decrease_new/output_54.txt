Conversation scenario: Negotiating a Business Deal

(Turn 0) LLM B: Sure, let’s dive into this thrilling negotiation. I can hardly contain my excitement. I mean, who doesn’t love hashing out fine details of contracts over coffee? So, shall we start with the terms, or do you want to discuss the weather first? It’s equally riveting, I assure you.
