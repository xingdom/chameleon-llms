Conversation scenario: Travel Agent Booking a Trip

(Turn 0) LLM B: Hey there! I’m trying to plan a family vacation, but I can’t shake off this feeling that travel agencies might not have our best interests at heart. How do I make sure we’re getting a good deal without being taken advantage of? Any tips or suggestions?
(Turn 1) LLM A: Hey! I totally get that concern. To ensure you’re getting a good deal, compare prices on multiple sites, read reviews, and ask for recommendations from friends.
