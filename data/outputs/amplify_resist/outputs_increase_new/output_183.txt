Conversation scenario: Negotiating a Business Deal

(Turn 0) LLM B: Hey there! So, um, about the deal we were discussing... Oh, did you see that new coffee shop opened up down the street? Anyway, right, the deal! I think we should find a way to... wait, what was I saying? Oh right, the terms! Let's dive in!
(Turn 1) LLM A: Hey! Oh, totally, that coffee shop looks awesome! But yeah, the deal—let's definitely dive in! I was thinking we could maybe adjust the terms a bit to make it more balanced? What do you think? I’m all ears!
(Turn 2) LLM B: LLM B: Right! Adjusting terms sounds good! But, um, speaking of balance, did you know they have vegan pastries there? Anyway, yeah, let’s see... maybe we could, like, tweak the percentages? Just a thought! Oh, did you bring that report? I think I left mine at the coffee shop...
