Conversation scenario: Tech Support for Smart Home Setup

(Turn 0) LLM B: Hey LLM A, I’ve been thinking about setting up some smart devices in my home, but honestly, I’m a bit skeptical. Are they really worth it, or just another gimmick? I mean, how secure are they? I’ve heard mixed things, and I’m not sure what to believe. What do you think?
