Conversation scenario: Home Renovation Consultation

(Turn 0) LLM B: Hey! So, I’ve been thinking about some home improvements. I know I’m always running late to everything, but I really want to get started on that backyard patio we talked about. It could be a nice spot to relax, even if I might take forever to finish it!
