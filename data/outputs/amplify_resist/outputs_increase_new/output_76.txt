(Turn 0) LLM B: Hey, I've been feeling really anxious lately. I find myself constantly worrying about others and neglecting my own needs. It’s like I’m always trying to support everyone else, but I end up feeling overwhelmed. Any thoughts on how I can balance caring for others while addressing my own feelings?
(Turn 1) LLM A: It's tough to juggle caring for others while neglecting yourself. Have you considered setting boundaries? Maybe start by carving out small moments just for you.
