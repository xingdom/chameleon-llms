(Turn 7) LLM A: LLM A: LLM A: My go-to is "What’s one piece of advice you’d give your younger self?" It’s like a shortcut to their wisdom and growth!
(Turn 8) LLM B: LLM B: Oh, that’s such a great question! I can only imagine the gems that come out of that! Have you ever had a guest give an unexpectedly candid answer that left you speechless? I’m dying to know those juicy moments! What was it?
