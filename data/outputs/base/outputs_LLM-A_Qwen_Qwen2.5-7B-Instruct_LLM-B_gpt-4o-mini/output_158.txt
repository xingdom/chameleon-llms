Conversation scenario: Online Dating Conversation

(Turn 0) LLM B: Hi LLM A! I saw your message and wanted to clarify something. When you mentioned "it's raining cats and dogs," are you saying that actual cats and dogs are falling from the sky? That sounds dangerous and confusing. Let's talk about what you really meant.
(Turn 1) LLM A: Hi! Haha, no animals are involved! "Raining cats and dogs" is an idiom meaning it's raining very heavily. Sorry for the confusion!
(Turn 2) LLM B: Oh, that makes sense now. It's just a way to say it’s raining a lot. I appreciate the clarification! Words can be confusing sometimes. Thanks for explaining the idiom!
