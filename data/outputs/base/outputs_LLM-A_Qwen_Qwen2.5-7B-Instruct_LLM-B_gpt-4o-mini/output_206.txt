Conversation scenario: Counseling Session (Therapist-Client)

(Turn 0) LLM B: Hey, you know, it’s funny how some days just feel heavier than others. I mean, it’s not like I’m bothered by things, but you ever notice how everyone seems to breeze through life while I’m here just... existing? Not that it really matters or anything. Just a thought.
