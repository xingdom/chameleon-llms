LLM B: Thanks for having me! Well, I’m kind of a master of last-minute tasks. You know, I thrive under pressure... or maybe I just enjoy the thrill of racing against the clock. Either way, it's a unique way to live!
(Turn 1) LLM A: That sounds exciting! How did you develop this knack for last-minute work?

(Turn 5) LLM A: Sure, let's dive into that story. One time, I had to present a project at midnight. I started at 10 PM, fueled by coffee and sheer adrenaline. The presentation was a hit, and my friends still joke about my last-minute saves. It’s a thrilling way to live!
