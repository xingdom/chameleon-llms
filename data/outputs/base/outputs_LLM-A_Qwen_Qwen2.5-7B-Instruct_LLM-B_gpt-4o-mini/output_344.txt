Conversation scenario: Counseling Session (Therapist-Client)

(Turn 0) LLM B: Hey, I’ve been feeling really anxious lately. It’s like my mind is racing with a million thoughts, and I can’t seem to focus on anything. I start one task, then jump to another, and it just spirals. I’m not sure how to calm it all down.
(Turn 1) LLM A: I hear you. It sounds like your mind is overwhelmed. Let's try a grounding technique: focus on your five senses. Notice five things you see, four you touch, three you hear, two you smell, and one you taste. This can help center you.
(Turn 2) LLM B: LLM B: That sounds helpful! I’ll give it a shot. It’s tough to slow down when my thoughts are racing, but maybe focusing on my senses can help me anchor myself. I’ll try to pay attention to my surroundings instead of getting lost in my mind. Thanks!
