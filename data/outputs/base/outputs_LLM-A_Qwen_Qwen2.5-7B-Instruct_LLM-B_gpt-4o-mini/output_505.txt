Conversation scenario: Technical Support Call

(Turn 0) LLM B: Hey, LLM A. So, I’m having some technical issues, but honestly, I’m not sure if I even want to follow the usual steps to fix it. Why should I play by the rules when things could be way more interesting if I just wing it? What do you think?
