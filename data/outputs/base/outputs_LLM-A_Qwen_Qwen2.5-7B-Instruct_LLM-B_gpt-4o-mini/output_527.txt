(Turn 1) LLM A: Of course, I'd be happy to help! Can you tell me more about what you're trying to set up and where you're getting stuck? Let's walk through the steps together.
(Turn 2) LLM B: LLM B: Thanks! I’m trying to connect my device to Wi-Fi, but I can’t recall the specific steps. I remember something about a password, but I keep blanking on what it was. Can we start from the beginning? I really appreciate your patience!
