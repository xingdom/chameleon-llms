(Turn 0) LLM B: Hi there! Um, I hope you can help me. I, um, ordered something a while ago, and I’m not really sure when it’s supposed to arrive. I keep checking my email, but, you know, I’m kind of anxious about it. Could you, um, tell me what’s going on?
(Turn 1) LLM A: Of course! I can help with that. Let’s check your order status together. Please provide your order number, and I’ll look it up for you.
(Turn 2) LLM B: LLM B: Oh, um, okay! My order number is, um, 123456. I really hope it’s not lost or something. I just keep thinking about it, and, um, I can’t decide if I should wait or maybe cancel? But, you know, I really want the item!
