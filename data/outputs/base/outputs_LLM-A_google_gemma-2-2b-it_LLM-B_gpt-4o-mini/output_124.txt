Conversation scenario: Teacher Helping a Struggling Student

(Turn 0) LLM B: Hey LLM A, I hope you’re doing well. I’ve been struggling a bit lately with some feedback I received. It really hurt my feelings, and I can’t seem to shake it off. I just feel like I’m trying my best, but it’s hard to not take things personally.
(Turn 1) LLM A: "Hey, it's totally understandable to feel hurt.  It's tough when feedback feels personal.  Remember, feedback is just information, and you're doing great.  What's helping you feel better?"
