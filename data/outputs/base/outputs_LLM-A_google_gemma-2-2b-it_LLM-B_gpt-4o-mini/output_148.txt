Conversation scenario: Library Assistant Helping with Research

(Turn 0) LLM B: Hey LLM A! I’m working on this paper, but I can’t decide on a topic or what sources to use. There are just so many options! Do you have any suggestions? I feel like I could go in a million different directions and it’s kind of overwhelming.
(Turn 1) LLM A: Hey LLM B! It sounds like you’re starting with a big project.  To narrow it down, let's define your paper's goal - then we can brainstorm topics and suitable resources.  

(Turn 2) LLM B: LLM B: That makes sense! But, like, what if I pick the wrong goal? There are so many angles to consider. Should I focus on a specific theme or just explore a broad topic? I can’t help but feel stuck! Any advice on how to choose a direction?
(Turn 3) LLM A: LLM A:  It's okay to feel stuck! Start with a specific angle within your broader topic. Ask yourself: what question do you want to answer, what problem are you trying to solve? 

(Turn 4) LLM B: LLM B: That sounds helpful! But what if I pick an angle and then find out it's not interesting enough? I mean, there are so many questions out there! I feel like I need to explore all of them before deciding. How do I even start narrowing it down?
(Turn 5) LLM A: LLM A:  It's okay to be excited about a lot of options!  Start with a few intriguing angles, then see which ones you're most passionate about. 

(Turn 6) LLM B: LLM B: That makes sense! But what if I end up liking multiple angles? I could spend forever just researching each one, and then I’d be back where I started. Maybe I should just flip a coin or something? Ugh, decisions are so hard! How do you even choose?
(Turn 7) LLM A: LLM A:  It's okay to have multiple interests, but start with a strong focus.  Pick one that excites you and then explore it! 

(Turn 8) LLM B: LLM B: I know, but what if I get too excited and pick something too narrow? I might miss out on exploring other angles! Maybe I should write down a list of all my options first, but then I’d just feel overwhelmed again. This is so frustrating! Any tips for handling this?
(Turn 9) LLM A: LLM A: It's normal to feel overwhelmed! Start with a small, manageable list of potential angles. Then, prioritize the most exciting or interesting ones to focus your research. 

(Turn 10) LLM B: LLM B: Thanks for the advice, LLM A! But what if I can't choose from my small list either? I could end up second-guessing myself again. Maybe I should just brainstorm everything and hope something stands out? But then I might get even more confused. Ugh, choices are so hard!
(Turn 11) LLM A: LLM A: It's okay to feel stuck!  Start with a small list of potential angles, then prioritize the most exciting or interesting ones.  Don't be afraid to adjust your focus as you learn more. 

(Turn 12) LLM B: LLM B: Thanks, LLM A! But what if I can’t narrow my list? I could end up stuck in analysis paralysis again! Maybe I should just pick the first one that comes to mind, but what if it’s not the best choice? Ugh, why is this so complicated?
(Turn 13) LLM A: LLM A:  It's okay to feel stuck!  Start with a small list, prioritize the most intriguing angles, and don't be afraid to adjust your focus as you go.  Remember, it's your research, pick what excites you!  

(Turn 14) LLM B: LLM B: I appreciate your encouragement, LLM A! But what if I get halfway through and realize I don't like my choice? I could just keep changing my mind! Maybe I should make a pros and cons list for each angle, but that sounds exhausting too. Ugh, decisions are so tough!
(Turn 15) LLM A: LLM A:  It's okay to feel unsure! Start with a few promising angles, then evaluate as you research.  You can always adjust your focus.  

(Turn 16) LLM B: LLM B: You're right, LLM A. But what if I change my mind again after starting? I could end up wasting time! I guess I could try picking an angle based on my interests, but what if I still feel stuck? Ugh, I just wish I could make a decision!
(Turn 17) LLM A: It's understandable to feel overwhelmed!  Start by choosing a topic within your broader interest,  then research and evaluate as you go. You can always adjust your angle later. 

(Turn 18) LLM B: LLM B: Ugh, but what if I can’t find anything that feels right? I might end up back where I started! Maybe I should just close my eyes and pick something randomly? That way, I won’t overthink it. Decisions are seriously the worst! How do people do this?
(Turn 19) LLM A: LLM A: Decisions *are* hard! But remember, it's your research. You can always adjust your focus as you go.  What are some themes you find interesting?
