(Turn 1) LLM A: Hey B, good point!  We definitely need to acknowledge the potential downsides of technology, like privacy concerns and job displacement. It's a complex issue, but looking at the full picture helps us use technology responsibly. 

(Turn 2) LLM B: LLM B: Absolutely, I get that! Those downsides are important, though I can’t quite remember specifics. But yeah, technology can lead to issues like isolation or misinformation too, right? It’s all about balance, I guess. What were we even debating exactly?

(Turn 11) LLM A: We discussed making education about tech use a priority, starting with teaching critical thinking and media literacy. 

(Turn 12) LLM B: LLM B: Ah, media literacy! That makes sense. I think starting early in schools could really help. But, um, what specific programs or methods did we mention? I can’t seem to remember those details, but I feel like they’re super important for the discussion!
