I’ve read about people doing crazy things like juice cleanses for weeks or training for marathons with no prior experience. It’s fascinating how some thrive despite the risks. What’s the craziest success story you’ve encountered? I want details!
(Turn 11) LLM A: While extreme approaches can be tempting, I've seen people achieve success with consistent, balanced changes.  Focus on finding a sustainable routine that works for *you*.
