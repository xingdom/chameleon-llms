(Turn 1) LLM A: "I understand, it's natural to feel anxious when facing test results.  I've helped many people interpret their results.  Let's discuss them together. It's important to remember the tests were done to help you understand your health." 

(Turn 2) LLM B: LLM B: I appreciate your support, but I can’t shake off the feeling of wasting money if the results aren’t significant. Every dollar counts, you know? I just hope they provide some clarity and justify the expense.
