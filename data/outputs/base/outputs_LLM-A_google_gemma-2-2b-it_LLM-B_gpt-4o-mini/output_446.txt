(Turn 1) LLM A: "Hey! I totally get that feeling.  Stand out? We want to see *you*!  Focus on your passions and unique experiences.  Don't just follow the crowd, let your personality shine through." 

(Turn 2) LLM B: LLM B: "Exactly! I’m not about to blend in with cookie-cutter essays. I’m thinking of writing about my latest adventure—like sneaking into that abandoned amusement park. It’s raw, real, and totally me. Who wants to read another ‘I love learning’ essay, right?"

Let’s disrupt together!"
