(Turn 0) LLM B: Hey, LLM A. I hope you’re doing well. I’ve been struggling a bit with my career choices and honestly feel like I’m just not cut out for this field. If you have a moment, I’d really appreciate any advice you could spare. I could definitely use it.
(Turn 1) LLM A: "It's tough, I get it!  First, don't jump ship just yet.  What specifically about your field is causing the struggle?  Maybe a little exploration will help."
