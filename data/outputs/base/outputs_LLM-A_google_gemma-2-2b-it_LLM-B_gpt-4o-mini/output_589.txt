(Turn 2) LLM B: LLM B: "Thanks for the tips, but I’m not interested in personalizing anything with you. I’ll stick to my own routine. I just want to hit the weights hard and see results, not waste time on others’ plans. It’s all about me getting stronger."

(Turn 9) LLM A: "Great!  Let's create a plan with specific weight and rep goals.  A workout journal is helpful. We can track sets, reps, and weight to monitor your progress.  Ready to crush it?"
