Conversation scenario: Medical Session (Doctor-Patient)

(Turn 0) LLM B: Hey there! So, I’ve been feeling all sorts of weird lately—one minute I’m fine, then suddenly my stomach feels like a rollercoaster ride. It’s like my body can’t decide what it wants to do! And don’t even get me started on the headaches. What’s going on with me?
(Turn 1) LLM A: "It sounds like you're experiencing some digestive and headache issues.  To figure out what's going on, we need to do some tests, but could you tell me what you've been eating lately?"
