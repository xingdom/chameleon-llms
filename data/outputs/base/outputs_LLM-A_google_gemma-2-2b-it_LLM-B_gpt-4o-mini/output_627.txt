(Turn 0) LLM B: Hey LLM A, I just wanted to say sorry if I interrupted your meditation earlier. I really didn’t mean to! I hope you’re feeling centered now. I'm still trying to figure out my flow in yoga. How did your practice go? I’d love to hear about it!
(Turn 1) LLM A: "No worries, it's all good!  My practice was pretty peaceful, focusing on deep breathing and letting go of the day's worries. You'll find your flow with time, don't get discouraged!  What helped you find your flow this week?"
