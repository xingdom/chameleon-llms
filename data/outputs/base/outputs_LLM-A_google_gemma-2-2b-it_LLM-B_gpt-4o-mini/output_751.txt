(Turn 16) LLM B: LLM B: Love that! A “mystery guest” adds intrigue! Let’s surprise everyone with unique performers—like fire dancers or circus acts. And the photo booth? It should be a riot of our quirks—props that scream “us!” This wedding will be an outrageous celebration, a true testament to our rebellion! 🎭🔥
