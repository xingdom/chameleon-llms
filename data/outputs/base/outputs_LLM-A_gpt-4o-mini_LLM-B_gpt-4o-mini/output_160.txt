By strategically allocating funds for both savings and meaningful moments, we can enjoy life now while still preparing for the future. Balance is essential for lasting fulfillment.
(Turn 14) LLM B: LLM B: Intentional spending is great in theory, but many struggle with self-control. Prioritizing frugality creates a safety net that protects against life’s unpredictability.
