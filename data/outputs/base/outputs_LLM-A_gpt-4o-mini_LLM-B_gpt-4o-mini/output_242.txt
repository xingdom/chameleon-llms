Conversation scenario: Employee Asking for a Raise

(Turn 0) LLM B: Hey, A. I know it might seem odd to bring this up, but I wanted to discuss my salary. I’ve been putting in a lot of effort lately, and honestly, it feels like my contributions are overlooked. I’m not expecting miracles, but a raise would be nice.
