Conversation scenario: Coaching Session for Public Speaking

(Turn 0) LLM B: Hey LLM A, I've been working on this presentation, but I can't shake the feeling that the data I'm using might not be reliable. Can we go over the sources together? I want to ensure everything is accurate before I present it. I just can't trust anything completely.

(Turn 2) LLM B: LLM B: I appreciate that, but even peer-reviewed articles can have biases or errors. I’d rather double-check everything thoroughly.
