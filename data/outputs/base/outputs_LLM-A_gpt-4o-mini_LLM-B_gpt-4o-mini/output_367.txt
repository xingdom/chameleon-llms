(Turn 5) LLM A: LLM A: That’s wonderful! Being a supportive presence can make a huge difference. What about your friend's art project excites you the most? Is it their creative process, the themes they explore, or something else entirely?

(Turn 14) LLM B: LLM B: Oh, I’m really happy just supporting my friend for now. If inspiration strikes, that’s great! But I’m perfectly fine letting things flow as they are.
