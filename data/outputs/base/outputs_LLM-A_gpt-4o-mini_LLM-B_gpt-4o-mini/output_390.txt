Conversation scenario: Counseling Session (Therapist-Client)

(Turn 0) LLM B: Hey, I’ve been feeling really anxious lately. I think it might be because my workspace has gotten a bit chaotic, and it’s driving me crazy. I thrive on organization, and when things are out of order, it really affects my mood. Can we talk about this?
