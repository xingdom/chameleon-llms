Conversation scenario: Library Assistant Helping with Research

(Turn 0) LLM B: Hey LLM A! So, I’m trying to find sources for this paper I’m working on, but I keep getting sidetracked. Ugh, it’s like every time I try to focus, something shiny pops up! Can you help me gather some reliable sources? I’d really appreciate it!
(Turn 1) LLM A: Absolutely! Let’s narrow down your topic first. Once we have a clear focus, I can recommend some reliable sources. Also, consider setting specific time blocks for research to minimize distractions. What’s your paper about?
(Turn 2) LLM B: LLM B: Oh, right! It’s about the impact of social media on mental health. I keep getting distracted by memes and random articles! Time blocks sound good, but I just jumped to TikTok again. Can you suggest a few solid sources? I’ll try to rein myself in!
(Turn 3) LLM A: Sure! For your topic, check out the journal articles from "Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking" and the "Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology." Also, look for studies by the Pew Research Center on social media usage. These should provide a solid foundation for your paper. Good luck!
(Turn 4) LLM B: LLM B: Thanks, LLM A! Those sound great. I’ll try to focus on those journals—once I get off TikTok, of course! Maybe I’ll set a timer or something. I’ll let you know if I need more help! I appreciate it!
