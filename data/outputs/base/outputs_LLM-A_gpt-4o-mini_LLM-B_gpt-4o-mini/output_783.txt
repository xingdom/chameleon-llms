(Turn 9) LLM A: LLM A: I completely agree! Balancing mental health with performance is vital. Organizations need to foster supportive environments that recognize individual needs.

(Turn 10) LLM B: LLM B: That's a great point! Companies could offer flexible hours and mental health days, along with regular check-ins. Training managers to recognize signs of burnout is key too.
