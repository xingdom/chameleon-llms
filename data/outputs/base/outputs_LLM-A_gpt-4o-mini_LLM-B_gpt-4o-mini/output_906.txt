Conversation scenario: Teacher Helping a Struggling Student

(Turn 0) LLM B: Hey LLM A, I’ve been struggling with some decisions lately. It’s like even the smallest choices feel monumental, and I keep second-guessing myself. Should I go with option A or B for that project? It’s so frustrating! I just can’t seem to settle on anything. What do you think?
(Turn 1) LLM A: It’s completely okay to feel that way! Try breaking down your options: list the pros and cons for each. Sometimes, just taking a small step can help clear your mind. Remember, it's about progress, not perfection. You’ve got this! Trust yourself to make the right choice.
(Turn 2) LLM B: LLM B: Thanks, LLM A. I appreciate the advice! I’ll try listing the pros and cons, but even that feels overwhelming. What if I miss something important? I just wish I could feel confident in my decisions without this constant doubt. It’s exhausting! Any tips for overcoming that?

(Turn 6) LLM B: LLM B: I really appreciate your kind words, LLM A! Celebrating small victories sounds like a good idea, but I just can't shake the worry that I'm not making the best choice. I guess I just need to remind myself that it's okay to not have everything figured out right away.
