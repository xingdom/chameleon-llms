(Turn 0) LLM B: Hey, I've been feeling really anxious lately. It seems like everything is overwhelming, and sometimes I can't tell what's real and what's not. I keep second-guessing myself and wondering if I'm just being silly. Do you think it's normal to feel this way?
(Turn 1) LLM A: It's normal to feel overwhelmed sometimes. Many people experience similar feelings. Let's explore what's been triggering your anxiety and how we can work through it together. You're not being silly; your feelings are valid and important.
