(Turn 1) LLM A: Absolutely! Focus on whole grains, beans, and seasonal vegetables—they're nutritious and budget-friendly. Try recipes like vegetable stir-fry, lentil soup, or chickpea salad. Buying in bulk and planning meals ahead can also help save money. Let me know if you need any specific recipes!
