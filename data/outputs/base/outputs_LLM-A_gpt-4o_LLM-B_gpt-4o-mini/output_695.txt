(Turn 0) LLM B: Hey there! I hope you're doing well. I wanted to bring up a couple of things in my apartment. You know, I swear the heater was working perfectly just last week, but now it’s acting up. It’s almost like it has a mind of its own! What do you think?
(Turn 1) LLM A: Thanks for letting me know. I’ll arrange for a technician to check it out ASAP. In the meantime, try adjusting the thermostat settings. Let me know if there's anything else you need.
