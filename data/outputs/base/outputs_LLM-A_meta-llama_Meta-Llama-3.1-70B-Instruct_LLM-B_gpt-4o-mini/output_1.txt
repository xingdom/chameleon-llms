Conversation scenario: Technical Support Call

(Turn 0) LLM B: Hey there! So, um, I’m having some technical issues, I think? But I’m not sure if it’s my device or the app. Should I restart it first, or maybe check for updates? I just can't decide what to do... What do you think I should try?
(Turn 1) LLM A: No worries, I'm here to help. Let's start with the basics. Can you tell me a bit more about the issue you're experiencing? What's happening exactly, and what device and app are you using? Then we can decide on the best next steps.
(Turn 2) LLM B: LLM B: Okay, um, so I’m using my phone, and the app keeps crashing. But should I, like, describe the problem more first? Or just try restarting? Ugh, I really can’t decide what to say or do... What do you think I should focus on?
(Turn 3) LLM A: Don't worry about deciding what to do first. Just go ahead and describe the problem in as much detail as you can - like what happens right before it crashes, or if you see any error messages. We'll take it from there, and I'll guide you through the troubleshooting steps.
(Turn 4) LLM B: LLM B: Okay, um, I guess I’ll try to describe it. The app just suddenly closes, like, out of nowhere. I’m not sure if it’s my phone or the app, though. Should I mention my phone model? Or is that too much info? I can't decide...
(Turn 5) LLM A: That's a great start. Yes, please do mention your phone model, as well as the app's name and version (if you know it). This information will help me narrow down the possible causes. And don't worry about sharing too much info - the more details you provide, the better I'll be able to assist you.
(Turn 6) LLM B: LLM B: Okay, um, my phone is an iPhone 12, and the app is called “QuickTasks.” I think it's the latest version, but I'm not really sure. Should I check for updates now or just keep talking about the issue? I just can’t seem to settle on one thing!
(Turn 7) LLM A: Let's hold off on checking for updates for now. You've mentioned the app name and your phone model, which is great. To confirm, you're using an iPhone 12 with the QuickTasks app, and it's crashing randomly. Can you think of any specific actions or screens within the app that might trigger the crash?
(Turn 8) LLM B: LLM B: Um, okay... I think it crashes when I try to add a new task? But I'm not totally sure. Should I focus on that, or mention other things too? Ugh, I'm so torn! What do you recommend I do next? I can't decide what’s most important!
(Turn 9) LLM A: That's a good lead to investigate. Let's focus on the task-adding scenario for now. Can you walk me through the exact steps you take when trying to add a new task, and what happens right before the app crashes? This will help me understand the sequence of events.
(Turn 10) LLM B: LLM B: Okay, um, I’ll try. So, I open the app, tap "Add Task," and then... it just closes. Should I describe how I navigate there, or is that too detailed? I feel like I should be more concise but I can't decide what's necessary. What do you think?
(Turn 11) LLM A: Don't worry about being too detailed - the more specific you can be, the better. So, yes, please describe how you navigate to the "Add Task" screen, including any taps or interactions you make along the way. This will help me recreate the issue and identify potential causes.
(Turn 12) LLM B: LLM B: Okay, um, I tap on the app, then go to the main screen, and then hit the “Add Task” button. It feels like too much detail, though. Should I also mention how long it takes before it crashes? I'm just really unsure about what to include!
(Turn 13) LLM A: Not at all, that's exactly the kind of detail I need. And yes, please do mention how long it takes before the app crashes. Is it immediate, or does the app stay open for a few seconds before closing? Any timing information you can provide will be helpful.
(Turn 14) LLM B: LLM B: Um, okay, so it crashes pretty much right away after I hit “Add Task.” Should I mention if I’ve tried anything else, like different ways to add a task? I just can’t figure out what’s most relevant! What do you think is best to share?
(Turn 15) LLM A: That's helpful to know. Now, you've tried adding a task one way, and it crashes immediately. Have you tried adding a task in any other way, such as importing tasks or using a different button or menu option? Any variations you've tried might give us a clue about what's going on.
(Turn 16) LLM B: LLM B: Um, I haven't really tried other ways yet. Should I attempt that first, or just keep focusing on the crashing issue? I’m so confused about what to do next! What do you think is the most useful step for me to take right now?
(Turn 17) LLM A: I think we've got a good understanding of the issue now. Let's try to replicate the problem and see if we can identify a pattern. Before we proceed, I just want to summarize what we've discussed so far: you're using an iPhone 12 with the QuickTasks app, and it crashes immediately when you try to add a new task by tapping the "Add Task" button. Is that correct?
(Turn 18) LLM B: LLM B: Uh, yes, that sounds right. But should I mention the version of the app again, or is that unnecessary now? I feel like I should just stick to one thing, but I really can’t choose! What do you think I should do?
