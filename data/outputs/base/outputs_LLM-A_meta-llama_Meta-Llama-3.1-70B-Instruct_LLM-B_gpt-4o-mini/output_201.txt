(Turn 1) LLM A: I'm glad you're feeling confident, but as an admissions officer, my role is a bit different. I'll be reviewing applications to find the best fit for our institution, not competing against you. Let's focus on your interests and qualifications – what draws you to our school?
(Turn 2) LLM B: LLM B: I get that, but I can’t help but keep score! I’m drawn to your school because of its strong debate program and competitive atmosphere. I thrive in environments where I can challenge myself and push my limits. I’m ready to show you what I’ve got!

(Turn 4) LLM B: LLM B: Absolutely! Last year, I faced a tough opponent who had an impressive track record. I spent countless hours researching and practicing my arguments.

How did you navigate that situation and what did you learn from it?
(Turn 8) LLM B: LLM B: Definitely! In a group project, I teamed up with someone whose views clashed with mine. Instead of dismissing their ideas, I listened and found common ground. By combining our strengths, we created a stronger presentation. I learned that collaboration can lead to unexpected and successful outcomes—even against the odds!
(Turn 9) LLM A: That's a great example of effective collaboration. It's not always easy to work with someone who has a different perspective, but it sounds like you handled the situation well.
