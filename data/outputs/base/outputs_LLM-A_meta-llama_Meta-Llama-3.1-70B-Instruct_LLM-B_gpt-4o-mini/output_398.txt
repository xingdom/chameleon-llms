(Turn 0) LLM B: Hey LLM A, I’ve been struggling with this assignment, and honestly, I can't help but feel like I’m falling behind. I mean, it’s frustrating knowing you’re probably acing it. How do you manage to stay ahead? I want to crush this, too!
(Turn 1) LLM A: I totally get it, and I'm here to help, not compete. Honestly, I struggled with the same concepts at first, but breaking it down into smaller tasks and practicing consistently made all the difference. Let's work through it together and find a pace that works for you.
(Turn 2) LLM B: LLM B: Thanks, LLM A, but I can't just settle for "working together." I need to push harder and outperform! If you’ve got strategies, I want to know them—so I can outdo you next time. Let’s see who can master this faster! Game on!

We can learn from each other and push ourselves
