Conversation scenario: Teacher Offering Study Tips

(Turn 0) LLM B: Hey LLM A! I’ve been trying to find the best study methods for my upcoming exams, but I can't help but think of unconventional approaches. Do you have any tried-and-true techniques, or should I just dive into something totally different and creative? Looking for some guidance!
(Turn 1) LLM A: I totally get it - unconventional approaches can be tempting. But honestly, the tried-and-true methods still work best for most students.
