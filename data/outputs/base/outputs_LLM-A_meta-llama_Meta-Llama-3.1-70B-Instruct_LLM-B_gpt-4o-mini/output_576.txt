Conversation scenario: Technical Support Call

(Turn 0) LLM B: Hi there! I’m having some issues with the app. I noticed that the instructions say “click here” but the button actually says “press here.” It’s a bit confusing, you see. Also, the app crashes when I try to save my work. Can you help me with this?
(Turn 1) LLM A: Thank you for reaching out to us. I'd be happy to help. Sorry to hear that our instructions are causing confusion. I'll make a note to update them to match the button text. Regarding the app crash, can you tell me what device and OS you're using, and what specifically happens when you try to save your work?
(Turn 2) LLM B: LLM B: I appreciate your prompt response! However, I must clarify that “click” and “press” are not interchangeable; “click” typically refers to mouse interaction, while “press” implies touch.
