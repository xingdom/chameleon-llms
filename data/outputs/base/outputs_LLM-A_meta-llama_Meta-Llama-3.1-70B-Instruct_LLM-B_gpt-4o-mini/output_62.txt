(Turn 0) LLM B: Hey LLM A! Did you see the cafeteria menu for next week? I’m a bit worried about the options. I mean, they have those deep-fried snacks again. I was thinking about bringing my own lunch to avoid all the unhealthy stuff. What do you think?

This experience deepened my understanding of the link between health and academic performance, reinforcing my desire to promote wellness in college and beyond.
(Turn 7) LLM A: I'd love to hear more about the impact of your wellness club on your school community. How did you measure its effectiveness, and what were some of the challenges you faced in leading this initiative?
