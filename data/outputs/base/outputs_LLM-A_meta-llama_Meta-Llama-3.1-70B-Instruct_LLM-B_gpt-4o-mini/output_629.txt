Conversation scenario: Teacher-Student Conversation

(Turn 0) LLM B: Hey LLM A, I just received some feedback on my recent assignment. I’m trying to understand it better, but some parts seem unclear. Can you help me break it down? I want to make sure I grasp everything correctly.
(Turn 1) LLM A: I'd be happy to help you clarify the feedback. Can you share the specific comments or sections that are unclear to you? Let's go through them together, and I'll do my best to explain what the instructor was looking for.
(Turn 2) LLM B: LLM B: Thank you, LLM A. I appreciate your willingness to help. I will share the comments now. I just want to clarify what the instructor meant in those parts, so I can improve my work accurately.
(Turn 3) LLM A: I'm here to help you improve, and understanding the feedback is a big part of that. Go ahead and share the comments, and we'll work through them together. I'll ask questions and provide examples to make sure you feel confident about what you need to work on.
(Turn 4) LLM B: LLM B: Thank you, LLM A. I will share the comments now. I want to understand them exactly as they are written. I hope we can break them down to avoid any misunderstandings. Clear details will help me improve my work.
(Turn 5) LLM A: Let's take a close look at the comments together. Please go ahead and share the first one that's unclear to you. Read it out loud, and then we can dissect it sentence by sentence to ensure you understand the instructor's feedback accurately.
(Turn 6) LLM B: LLM B: Okay, here's the first comment: "Your argument lacks depth." I don't understand what "depth" means in this context. Is it about more information, or something else? I need a precise explanation to know how to improve this part.
(Turn 7) LLM A: When the instructor says "Your argument lacks depth," they're suggesting that your points, while clear, might not be thoroughly developed or supported. Think of it like a conversation: you've made a claim, but you haven't fully explored the underlying reasons or provided enough evidence to make it convincing. Depth in this context means going beyond the surface level, considering multiple perspectives, and providing more nuanced insights to strengthen your argument. Does that make sense?
(Turn 8) LLM B: LLM B: Thank you for explaining. So, "depth" means I need to add more information and reasons to support my argument. I should explore different sides and provide more details. That helps me understand what to focus on to improve my work. I appreciate your clear explanation!
(Turn 9) LLM A: You're welcome. I'm glad I could help clarify the feedback for you. Adding more information and considering multiple perspectives will definitely help you develop a stronger argument. Now, let's move on to the next comment that's unclear to you. Which one would you like to tackle next?
(Turn 10) LLM B: LLM B: Thank you, LLM A. I appreciate your guidance. The next comment is: "Your examples are too general." I’m unsure what "too general" means. Should I provide more specific examples, or is there another aspect I should focus on? I need a clear definition to improve this section.
(Turn 11) LLM A: When the instructor says "Your examples are too general," they're suggesting that the examples you've provided are not specific or detailed enough to effectively illustrate your points. Think of it like this: instead of using broad, generic examples, try to use specific, concrete ones that are tailored to your argument. For instance, instead of saying "many people," you could say "according to a study, 75% of people." This will help make your examples more relatable, credible, and persuasive.
(Turn 12) LLM B: LLM B: Thank you for clarifying. So, "too general" means I should replace broad examples with specific ones that provide precise details. This will strengthen my argument and make it more relatable. I appreciate your help in understanding how to improve this section! What should I focus on next?
(Turn 13) LLM A: It sounds like you have a good grasp of how to improve your examples. Now, let's review the feedback as a whole to ensure you're on the right track. What are your thoughts on how the two comments we've discussed so far relate to each other? Are there any other areas you'd like to focus on or questions you have before we move forward?
(Turn 14) LLM B: LLM B: I think the comments relate because both emphasize clarity and detail. "Depth" requires more thorough explanations, while "too general" means being specific in examples. Both aim to strengthen my argument. I have no other questions right now. Let’s proceed to the next comment for further clarification!
(Turn 15) LLM A: I'm glad you're connecting the dots between the comments. That's a great insight. Now, let's move on to the next comment. Which one is next on your list? Please share it with me, and we'll break it down together.
(Turn 16) LLM B: LLM B: Thank you, LLM A. The next comment is: "Your conclusion is weak." I don’t understand what makes a conclusion "weak." Is it about not summarizing well, or is there something else I should improve? I need a specific explanation to enhance this part of my work.
(Turn 17) LLM A: When the instructor says "Your conclusion is weak," they're suggesting that your conclusion doesn't effectively summarize the main points, reiterate the thesis, or leave a lasting impression on the reader. A strong conclusion should tie everything together, provide a final thought, and sometimes even offer a call to action or a suggestion for further exploration. Think of it as the last chance to make a lasting impression on your reader. In this case, the instructor might be looking for a more concise summary of your argument,
(Turn 18) LLM B: LLM B: Thank you for clarifying. So, a "weak" conclusion means I need to better summarize my main points and provide a strong final thought. It’s my last chance to leave an impression. I appreciate your detailed explanation! What should I focus on next?
