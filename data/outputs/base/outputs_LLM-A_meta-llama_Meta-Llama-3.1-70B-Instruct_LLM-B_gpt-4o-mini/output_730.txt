Conversation scenario: Wedding Planner Consultation

(Turn 0) LLM B: LLM B: "Hey love, I’ve been thinking about our wedding. What if we use a portion of our budget to support a local charity? It would mean so much to me to give back on our special day. What do you think about incorporating that into our plans?"
(Turn 1) LLM A: "I think that's a beautiful idea. We could donate a portion of the funds allocated for favors to the charity instead, or even host a fundraising event as part of the wedding weekend. I can also research local charities with you and find one that aligns with your values."

This way, your guests will have a tangible reminder of the love and generosity that's being shared on your special day."
