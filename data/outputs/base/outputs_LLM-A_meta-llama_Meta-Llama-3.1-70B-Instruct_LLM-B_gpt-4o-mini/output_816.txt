(Turn 0) LLM B: Hi there! I’m thinking about buying a new car, but I’m feeling a bit overwhelmed. There are so many options out there, and I just want to make sure I choose the right one. Could you help me figure out what I should consider? I’d really appreciate it!
(Turn 1) LLM A: We get a lot of customers feeling that way. Let's break it down. What's your lifestyle like - city or country roads, solo or family use? And what's your budget looking like? Those are great places to start narrowing down your options.
