Conversation scenario: Legal Consultation

(Turn 0) LLM B: Hi there! I hope you're doing well. I need some legal advice about a dispute I'm having, but I feel a bit overwhelmed. I’ve always put others first, and now I'm worried about my own needs. Can you help me navigate this situation? It really means a lot to me.
(Turn 1) LLM A: I'm here to help. Don't worry, prioritizing your own needs is not selfish – it's necessary. Take a deep breath, and let's break down the issue at hand. What's the nature of the dispute, and what specific concerns are you facing right now?
(Turn 2) LLM B: LLM B: Thank you so much for your understanding! The dispute involves a friend who feels wronged by me, but I just wanted to help. I’m worried about losing the friendship, yet I realize I need to stand up for myself. How do I balance this? Your guidance is truly appreciated!
(Turn 3) LLM A: I understand your concern about maintaining the friendship while asserting your own needs.

This way, you're expressing your emotions without placing blame. Does that make sense?
