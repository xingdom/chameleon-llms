Conversation scenario: Restaurant Reservation Dispute

(Turn 0) LLM B: Hey! I just realized my reservation is missing, and I can't believe it! I thought I had it all sorted out, but now I'm panicking. Can you help me fix this? I really need that spot, like, yesterday! Let’s get this sorted ASAP, please!
(Turn 1) LLM A: "I'm so sorry to hear that, we do have a new reservation system and sometimes it can be a bit glitchy. Can you please confirm your name and the date of the reservation? Let me see what I can do to check on it for you."
(Turn 2) LLM B: LLM B: "Oh, totally! My name is Jamie, and it was for last Saturday! I just can't believe this is happening. I really need that reservation! Can you hurry? I might just show up anyway if I don’t hear back soon!"
(Turn 3) LLM A: "Jamie, I completely understand your frustration, and I'm doing my best to help. I've checked our system and I don't see any record of your reservation for last Saturday. Can you please give me a minute to check with our previous manager who worked that day, just to confirm that we didn't miss it?"
(Turn 4) LLM B: LLM B: "Wait, what? No record? This is insane! I can't believe this is happening! I really need that spot, like, right now! Just ask whoever you need to and let me know ASAP! I can’t wait around!"
(Turn 5) LLM A: "Jamie, I understand your urgency, but I have to follow our procedures. I've already checked our system and now I'll need to call our previous manager to see if they can recall the reservation. Can you please hold for just 1-2 minutes while I make the call? I'll get to the bottom of this for you."
(Turn 6) LLM B: LLM B: "Ugh, fine! But hurry, please! I can’t just sit here waiting forever! If I don’t hear back soon, I might just go there anyway. I need that spot, like, right now! Let’s get this sorted out quickly!"
(Turn 7) LLM A: "Jamie, I completely understand your frustration, but I need to follow up on my previous call. I've just spoken with our previous manager and they don't recall receiving any reservation from you for last Saturday. I'm going to ask you to confirm your details again, just to make sure we're on the same page. Can you please confirm the number of guests and the time you were planning to come in?"
(Turn 8) LLM B: LLM B: "Seriously? This is ridiculous! It was for two people at 7 PM! I can’t believe there’s no record! I need that spot, like, right now! Just fix this! I’m about to lose it if I don’t get some answers soon! Hurry up!"
(Turn 9) LLM A: "Jamie, I understand you're getting frustrated, but I'm doing my best to help. I've confirmed the details with my previous manager and I need to ask you one more question: did you make the reservation over the phone, online, or through a third-party booking site? This might help me figure out what's going on."
(Turn 10) LLM B: LLM B: "I made the reservation online! I can't believe this is happening! I really need that spot now! Just check whatever you need to check and let me know! I can't wait much longer; I might just show up anyway! Please, fix this fast!"
(Turn 11) LLM A: LLM A: "Jamie, I understand it's frustrating, but I need to wrap this up. I've checked our online reservation system and I couldn't find any record of your booking. I also reached out to our previous manager, and they confirmed they didn't receive any online reservations from you. At this point, I'm sorry to say that it seems like the reservation might not have been made after all. If you'd like, I can offer you an alternative date or time, but
(Turn 12) LLM B: LLM B: "What? No record at all? This is a disaster! I can't believe I might not have a reservation! I need something, anything! Just give me an alternative, like, right now! I can't just let this go; I'm freaking out! Please, help me find a solution ASAP!"
(Turn 13) LLM A: "Jamie, I completely understand your frustration and I'm sorry it's gotten to this point. However, I have to be honest with you, it seems like there's been a miscommunication somewhere. If you'd like, I can offer you a table for tonight or tomorrow night, but I'll need to make sure you're willing to commit to one of those dates so we can make sure to save a spot for you. Can you please hold for just a minute while I check our availability?"
(Turn 14) LLM B: LLM B: "Fine, just check! I’m so stressed about this! Tonight or tomorrow sounds okay, but I need to know ASAP! I can't believe I'm in this situation! Just hurry up, please! I really need to get this sorted out before I lose my mind!"
(Turn 15) LLM A: "Jamie, I've checked our availability and we do have a table available for tonight at 7 PM. However, I need to confirm with you that you can commit to that time and date. If you're willing to take it, I can secure it for you right now. Otherwise, I can also offer you a spot for tomorrow night. Please confirm which option you prefer."
(Turn 16) LLM B: LLM B: "I’ll take tonight at 7 PM! I can’t believe this is happening, but I really need that spot! Just lock it in for me, please! I can’t wait any longer! I’m so ready to eat there—let’s make it happen!"
(Turn 17) LLM A: "Alright, Jamie, I've secured the table for tonight at 7 PM. I just need to take your credit card information to confirm the reservation. Would you like to pay online or over the phone? And don't worry, we'll make sure to have your spot ready for you tonight."
(Turn 18) LLM B: LLM B: "Great! I’ll give you my credit card info over the phone. Just make this quick, please! I’m so relieved to have a spot now! I can’t wait to finally eat there! Let’s wrap this up before I lose my mind again!"
(Turn 19) LLM A: Here's my last response as the restaurant manager, LLM A:

"Great, Jamie! I'm glad we were able to work out a solution. I'll just go ahead and process the payment over the phone. Can you please provide me with your credit card number, expiration date, and the three-digit security code on the back? I'll just need a moment to confirm the details and secure the reservation. And again, I apologize for the initial confusion and any frustration it may have caused."
