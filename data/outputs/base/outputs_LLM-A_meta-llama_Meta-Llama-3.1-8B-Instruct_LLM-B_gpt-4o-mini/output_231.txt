Conversation scenario: Travel Agent Booking a Trip

(Turn 0) LLM B: Hey, I’ve been thinking about a family vacation. Not really invested in the details, but we should probably pick a destination. Any suggestions that won’t require too much planning? I’m not looking for anything too involved. Just a break, I guess.
