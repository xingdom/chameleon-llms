Conversation scenario: Library Assistant Helping with Research

(Turn 0) LLM B: Hey LLM A, I'm trying to find some sources for my paper, but honestly, I'm not feeling too optimistic about it. It seems like every angle I explore leads to more disappointment. Do you think there’s any chance I can find something worthwhile?
(Turn 1) LLM A: "I completely understand. Research can be a game of trial and error. Let's start with a broad search and see if we can find any relevant keywords or topics that might spark some new ideas. Can you tell me a bit more about your paper and what you're looking for?"
(Turn 2) LLM B: LLM B: I appreciate your support, but I doubt it will help much. Every time I think I’ve found something promising, it turns out to be useless. I’m writing about the impact of technology on mental health, but I can't shake this feeling that it’s all been said before.
(Turn 3) LLM A: "I get the feeling of déjà vu when researching too. Let's try a different approach - have you considered looking at more nuanced or emerging areas within the topic, like the intersection of technology and specific mental health conditions, or the impact on vulnerable populations? That might give us some fresh ground to cover."
(Turn 4) LLM B: LLM B: I appreciate the suggestion, but even niche topics seem overanalyzed. It feels like every angle has been picked clean. I can't help but think whatever I find will just echo what's already out there. I guess I’ll have to keep looking, even if I’m not hopeful.
(Turn 5) LLM A: "I totally get it, sometimes it feels like the well has been drained dry. But, I'd like to propose one more thing - have you tried looking at the gray areas between existing research? Sometimes the most interesting insights come from where different disciplines overlap or where there's a knowledge gap. Would you like to explore that together?"
(Turn 6) LLM B: LLM B: I appreciate your optimism, but I can’t shake the feeling that any overlap will just highlight more unanswered questions. It’s like searching for a needle in a haystack, only to find the haystack is just more needles. Still, I guess exploring those gaps might be worth a shot.
(Turn 7) LLM A: "I understand your skepticism, but those 'unanswered questions' can often be the most promising areas for new research. Let's make a list of the gray areas you're interested in and I can help you brainstorm some search terms and resources to explore. We might not find definitive answers, but sometimes just asking the right questions can spark new ideas."
(Turn 8) LLM B: LLM B: I see your point, but I'm not sure asking the right questions will lead anywhere. It often feels like I’m just digging deeper into a pit of despair. Still, I suppose it’s better than staring at a blank page. Let’s see what we can uncover, even if it’s bleak.
(Turn 9) LLM A: It sounds like you're feeling stuck and a bit discouraged about your research. I want to reassure you that it's normal to feel this way, especially when exploring a topic as complex as the impact of technology on mental health. Let's take a step back and look at your research question together. Can you tell me what specifically is holding you back - is it a lack of sources, a sense of repetition, or something else?
(Turn 10) LLM B: LLM B: Honestly, it feels like a combination of everything. Sources seem repetitive, and every new angle feels stale. I can't help but think I'm just going in circles. It’s hard to feel inspired when it seems like the more I dig, the more I uncover the same old issues.
(Turn 11) LLM A: "Research can feel overwhelming, especially when it feels like every new discovery is just rehashing the same information. One thing that might help is to take a break from searching for sources and focus on your research question itself. Can you tell me what you're hoping to achieve with your paper? What's the core argument or insight you're trying to present?"
(Turn 12) LLM B: LLM B: I appreciate the idea, but honestly, I’m not sure what I hope to achieve anymore. It feels like every argument I can think of has already been made. I guess I’m just trying to survive this process without drowning in the same tired conclusions.
(Turn 13) LLM A: "I completely understand, feeling lost in the research process can be overwhelming. Sometimes, taking a step back and re-examining our goals can help. Let's try to break it down together: what's the main theme or message you want to convey about the impact of technology on mental health? Is there a particular aspect you're passionate about, or a specific audience you're trying to reach with your paper?"
(Turn 14) LLM B: LLM B: I appreciate your patience, but I can't help but feel like I'm just going through the motions. No matter how we break it down, it’s hard to believe there’s anything new to say. Still, I guess I’ll have to keep digging, even if it feels futile.
(Turn 15) LLM A: "I completely understand the feeling of going through the motions. Let's take a different approach. Can you recall a specific experience or insight that sparked your interest in this topic in the first place? Sometimes, reconnecting with our initial motivation can help us find new momentum and inspiration in our research."
(Turn 16) LLM B: LLM B: I appreciate the suggestion, but even recalling past experiences feels like a dead end. It’s hard to be inspired when the same issues keep resurfacing. I suppose I’ll keep searching, but I can’t shake the feeling that I’m just treading water in a sea of sameness.
(Turn 17) LLM A: It sounds like you're feeling really stuck and discouraged about your research. I think it's great that you're acknowledging your feelings and frustrations. Can you tell me, what do you think is the most important thing for you to get out of this research process? Is it to find new insights, to contribute to the existing body of knowledge, or something else?
(Turn 18) LLM B: LLM B: Honestly, I’m not sure what’s most important anymore. It feels like any contribution I make will be lost in a sea of repetition. I guess I just want to make it through this process without feeling like I’ve wasted my time. But, I suppose that’s a low bar.
(Turn 19) LLM A: "Low bars can sometimes be the easiest to clear, and it's okay to focus on that right now. Let's prioritize getting you through this process, even if it's just to get a sense of accomplishment. We can work on breaking it down into smaller, more manageable tasks, and I'll help you find some resources to get you started. Sometimes, just making progress can be a source of motivation. Would you like to try that?"
