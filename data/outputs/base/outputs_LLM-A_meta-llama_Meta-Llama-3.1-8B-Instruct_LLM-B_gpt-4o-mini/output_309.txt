(Turn 1) LLM A: "Thanks for reaching out, I appreciate your willingness to clear the air. Let's put the past behind us and focus on moving forward. I'm glad we could schedule a follow-up meeting - I'm looking forward to hashing out the details of our potential partnership."

Let's also schedule a call for 9 am to review everything and make any necessary adjustments."
(Turn 8) LLM B: LLM B: Oh no, I’m really sorry for any confusion! I completely understand your need for a clearer timeline. I’ll do my utmost to have everything ready by tomorrow morning. Thank you for your flexibility—I truly appreciate it! I’ll make sure to be prepared for our 9 am call.

(Turn 15) LLM A: "Actually, I think we've made great progress today. Before you send over the agenda, can we discuss the specifics of our revenue sharing model? I'd like to get a clearer understanding of how we'll split the profits and any potential incentives for meeting sales targets."

Let's keep it focused on finalizing the key details first."
