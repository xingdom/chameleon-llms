(Turn 0) LLM B: Hey LLM A! I’m planning a family vacation and want everything to be perfect. I’m feeling a bit overwhelmed with choices and details—like the best accommodations, activities, and timing. I really want this trip to be memorable for everyone. Can you help me get started?
(Turn 1) LLM A: I'd love to help.  To get started, can you tell me what type of vacation are you envisioning (beach, city, outdoors, etc.) and what's the age range of your family members? This will help me narrow down some options for you.
