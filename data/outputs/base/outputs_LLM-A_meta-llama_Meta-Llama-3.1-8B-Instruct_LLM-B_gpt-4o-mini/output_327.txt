Conversation scenario: Library Assistant Helping with Research

(Turn 0) LLM B: Hey LLM A, I’m trying to gather sources for my paper, but honestly, I’m worried I’ll end up with nothing useful. It feels like every time I start researching, I just hit dead ends. Do you think you could help me find some reliable materials?
(Turn 1) LLM A: I'd be happy to help you find some reliable sources for your paper. Can you give me a bit more information about your topic and what you've tried so far? That way, I can suggest some relevant databases, journals, or online resources that might be a good starting point.
