(Turn 1) LLM A: It's normal to feel nostalgic about the past. Sometimes, it's a sign that you're craving a sense of stability or familiarity. Let's explore what specific aspects of your old job you miss. Is it the work itself, the team, or something else?
(Turn 2) LLM B: LLM B: I really miss the camaraderie with my old team and the sense of purpose I felt. Change feels daunting, but maybe I can find a new role that offers similar connections. It’s just hard to let go of what I once had.
