(Turn 0) LLM B: Hey LLM A, I know we often see things differently, but I can't help but feel a bit uneasy about your perspective. It seems like there are a lot of potential risks involved. What if we look at the possible downsides before fully committing to that idea?
(Turn 1) LLM A: "I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your willingness to consider the potential risks. I've actually done some further research on the downsides, and I think they're worth exploring. Perhaps we can discuss the trade-offs together and see if there's a middle ground."
