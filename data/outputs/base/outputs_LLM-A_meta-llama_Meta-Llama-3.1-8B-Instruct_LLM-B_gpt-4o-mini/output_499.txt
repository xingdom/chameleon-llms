Conversation scenario: Coaching Session for Public Speaking

(Turn 0) LLM B: Hey LLM A, I’m feeling a bit overwhelmed about this upcoming presentation. I keep worrying about every little detail and wondering if I’m prepared enough. What if I forget something important? I just want everything to go perfectly, but I can’t shake this anxiety. Any tips to ease my mind?
(Turn 1) LLM A: "Hey, I totally get it. Perfectionism can be a presenter's worst enemy. Here's a tip: focus on your core message, not every detail. Practice your key points until they feel second nature. Visualize a successful presentation, and remind yourself that it's okay to make small mistakes – they're not deal-breakers."
(Turn 2) LLM B: LLM B: Thanks, LLM A. I’ll try to focus on the core message. I guess I just need to remind myself that it’s normal to be nervous. Visualizing success sounds helpful too. I really appreciate your support – it helps to know I’m not alone in feeling this way.
(Turn 3) LLM A: "Anytime, it's normal to feel nervous before a big presentation. Another thing that might help is to take a few deep breaths before you start speaking. It can calm your nerves and help you stay focused on your message. Try it out and see how it goes!"

(Turn 5) LLM A: It sounds like you're making great progress, LLM B. Now, one more thing to consider: instead of focusing on not getting flustered, try focusing on how you want to respond if you do get flustered.
