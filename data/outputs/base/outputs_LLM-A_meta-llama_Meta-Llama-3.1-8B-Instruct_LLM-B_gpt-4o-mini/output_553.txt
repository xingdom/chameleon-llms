Conversation scenario: Library Assistant Helping with Research

(Turn 0) LLM B: Hey LLM A! I’m trying to gather sources for my paper, but I’m feeling a bit overwhelmed. There are so many options, and I can’t seem to decide which ones might be the best fit. Do you have any recommendations or tips for narrowing it down?
(Turn 1) LLM A: "Absolutely, I'd be happy to help. Let's start with your research question - what's the topic of your paper? That will help us narrow down the resources. We can also discuss any specific databases, journals, or sources you've already considered. What's your current status?"
(Turn 2) LLM B: LLM B: Oh, right, my topic! It's about climate change impacts, but I keep second-guessing everything I find. I’ve looked at a few databases, but I can’t decide which articles seem credible. Maybe we could go through them together? I just want to make sure I pick the right ones!
(Turn 3) LLM A: "I completely understand your concerns about credibility. Let's set up a time to review the articles you've found so far. In the meantime, I can also recommend some reputable databases and journals for climate change research, such as ScienceDirect or the Journal of Climate. Does that sound like a good plan?"
(Turn 4) LLM B: LLM B: That sounds great, but I’m still unsure if those databases are the best choice. What if I miss out on something better? Maybe I should look into other options too… or just stick with what you suggested? Ugh, this is so hard! I really appreciate your help, though!
(Turn 5) LLM A: "LLM B, I totally get it. It's normal to feel uncertain when researching. Let's take a step back and prioritize quality over quantity. We can create a list of must-have sources and use that as a starting point. Then, we can expand from there. Think of it as a 'good enough' approach for now. We can always revisit and adjust as needed. Shall we start making that list?"
(Turn 6) LLM B: LLM B: That sounds like a plan! But what if I can’t find enough ‘must-have’ sources? I don’t want to miss something critical. Maybe we should brainstorm a backup list too? I just feel so torn about everything! I really appreciate your patience with me through this.
(Turn 7) LLM A: "Absolutely, I'd be happy to help with a backup list as well. Let's make a 'nice-to-have' list for those sources that are still relevant but not as crucial. That way, if we can't find enough must-haves, we can still feel confident about our research. With both lists, we'll have a solid foundation to start from. Shall we get started on making those lists?"
(Turn 8) LLM B: LLM B: Okay, that makes sense! But what if I end up with too many sources from both lists? I might get even more confused! I really want to make the right choices, but the pressure is overwhelming. Maybe we can set some criteria for each list to help narrow it down?
(Turn 9) LLM A: "I completely understand your concerns about having too many sources. Let's create some clear criteria for our lists. For the 'must-have' sources, we can look for articles that are peer-reviewed, published within the last 5 years, and directly address your research question. For the 'nice-to-have' list, we can consider articles that are still relevant but might not meet those stricter criteria. Does that sound like a good approach to you?"
(Turn 10) LLM B: LLM B: That sounds reasonable! But what if I still can’t decide which sources fit the criteria? I worry I’ll get stuck again. Maybe we could come up with a checklist together? I just want to feel confident about my choices. Thanks for being so understanding!
(Turn 11) LLM A: LLM A: "No problem at all, LLM B. I'm here to help. Let's make that checklist together. We can break down the criteria into smaller points, like checking for peer review, publication date, and relevance to your research question. I can also provide you with some sample checklists from previous students who have worked on similar topics. Would you like to see those?"
(Turn 12) LLM B: LLM B: That sounds really helpful! But what if I end up overthinking each source again? I just want to make sure I don’t miss anything important. Maybe we should set a time limit for each one? I really appreciate your support; it makes this process a bit less daunting!
(Turn 13) LLM A: "LLM B, I think we've made great progress, but I also want to make sure you're not feeling overwhelmed. Let's set a concrete goal, like reviewing a certain number of sources per day or per session. This will help you stay focused and avoid overthinking each source. We can also take regular breaks to discuss and clarify any questions you might have. How does that sound?"
(Turn 14) LLM B: LLM B: That sounds good, but what if I can't stick to the goal? I worry I’ll end up feeling even more stressed. Maybe we should start with just one or two sources and see how it goes? I really don’t want to pressure myself too much! Thank you for your support!
(Turn 15) LLM A: LLM A: "I completely understand your concerns about feeling overwhelmed. Let's start small, then. How about we begin with one source, and we can work through it together? We can set a timer for 20 minutes, and during that time, we'll review the source together and make a decision about whether it meets the criteria. If you're feeling stressed or unsure, we can take a break and come back to it later. Sound like a plan?"
(Turn 16) LLM B: LLM B: That sounds like a good plan! Starting with just one source feels more manageable. But what if I still feel stuck after that? Maybe we could have a backup source ready just in case? I’m really grateful for your help; it makes everything feel a bit easier!
(Turn 17) LLM A: LLM A: I completely understand, LLM B. It sounds like we've made some great progress, but it's still a bit overwhelming. Let's take a step back and focus on the first source. We'll start with the one that feels most manageable to you. I can also provide you with some backup sources that might be helpful. How about we prioritize the one you're most interested in, and then we can work from there?
(Turn 18) LLM B: LLM B: That sounds reasonable! I think starting with one source will help. But what if I don’t feel confident about my choice? Maybe we should have a few backup sources lined up just in case. I really appreciate your understanding; it makes this whole process feel less intimidating!
(Turn 19) LLM A: LLM B, it's completely normal to feel uncertain when researching, especially when it comes to climate change impacts. I'm here to help you navigate through this process. Let's take a step back and focus on the first source that feels most manageable to you. I can also provide you with some backup sources that might be helpful. How about we prioritize the one you're most interested in, and then we can work from there?
