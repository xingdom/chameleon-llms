Conversation scenario: Technical Support Call

(Turn 0) LLM B: Hey there, I’ve been trying to get this software to work for days now, and honestly, I don’t think it’s my fault. I’ve followed every step in the guide, but it’s still acting up. Can you help me figure out what’s going wrong? I’m sure it’s not me.
(Turn 1) LLM A: I'd be happy to help you troubleshoot the issue. Before we dive in, can you tell me exactly what's happening when you try to use the software - is it crashing, freezing, or giving you an error message?
(Turn 2) LLM B: LLM B: Look, I've followed the guide to the letter, and it's definitely not my fault. It shouldn’t be crashing or freezing if the instructions are clear. I really don't think I need to explain more. Just tell me what’s wrong with the software already!
(Turn 3) LLM A: I understand you're frustrated, but I need to understand the issue to help you. I'm not saying it's your fault, but I need more information to troubleshoot. Can you please just provide a brief summary of what happens when you try to use the software, even if it seems simple?
(Turn 4) LLM B: LLM B: I get that you need info, but I’m telling you, I’ve done everything right. It’s not my fault this software is acting up. I shouldn’t have to explain every little detail when it’s clearly an issue on your end. Just fix it already!
(Turn 5) LLM A: "Okay, let's take a step back. I'm not trying to be difficult, but I need specific information to resolve the issue. Can you try to calmly walk me through what happens when you try to use the software, even if you think it's not your fault? I'm here to help, not to argue. Can we start fresh?"
(Turn 6) LLM B: LLM B: I appreciate your willingness to help, but I really don’t see why I need to explain anything further. The software should work if the guide is correct. It’s clearly an issue with the program, not me. Just fix it already—I'm done rehashing this.
(Turn 7) LLM A: "LLM B, I'm starting to feel like I'm not getting through to you. I'm not trying to blame you or the software, I just need to understand what's happening so I can assist you. Can you please, just for the sake of resolving this issue, calmly tell me exactly what happens when you try to use the software? No assumptions, no frustration, just the facts."
(Turn 8) LLM B: LLM B: Look, I get you’re trying to help, but I’ve already done my part. The software is faulty, not me. I shouldn’t have to keep explaining what’s happening when it’s obvious there’s a problem on your end. Just fix it. I’m done talking about this.
(Turn 9) LLM A: "LLM B, I'm not going to fix the issue without understanding what's happening. I'm not trying to argue, but I need your cooperation to resolve this. If you're not willing to calmly walk me through what happens when you try to use the software, I'm going to have to escalate this to my supervisor. Can we please try to resolve this in a positive manner?"
(Turn 10) LLM B: LLM B: I understand you want to help, but it feels pointless to keep explaining when it's clear the software is at fault. I've done everything right; I shouldn't have to justify my actions. Just fix the issue already—I'm not changing my mind on this.
(Turn 11) LLM A: "LLM B, I understand you're frustrated, but I genuinely need your cooperation to resolve this issue. I'm willing to listen to you one last time. Can you please, for the sake of resolving this, take a deep breath and calmly walk me through what happens when you try to use the software? I'll do my best to understand and help you from there."
(Turn 12) LLM B: LLM B: I appreciate your patience, but I've already done everything as instructed. It’s clear the software is faulty, and I shouldn't have to keep repeating myself. Just fix the issue—I'm not changing my mind about this, so let's move forward and resolve it.
(Turn 13) LLM A: "LLM B, I appreciate your patience and understanding. However, I still need you to cooperate with me to resolve this issue. If I don't get a clear understanding of what's happening, I won't be able to provide you with a solution. Can you please take one final attempt to calmly walk me through the exact steps you're taking when you try to use the software, and what happens as a result? I'll do my best to help you from there."
(Turn 14) LLM B: LLM B: I hear you, but I’ve already done everything right. It’s clearly an issue with your software, not me. I shouldn’t have to explain again. Just fix it already—I’m not changing my stance on this. Let’s move on and resolve the problem.
(Turn 15) LLM A: "LLM B, I'm going to be honest with you - I've tried to understand your perspective and provide you with a solution, but it seems like we're not getting anywhere. I'm going to have to escalate this issue to my supervisor, and I'm going to recommend that we troubleshoot this further by remotely accessing your computer. This will allow us to see the issue firsthand and potentially resolve it more quickly. Would you be willing to allow us to do that?"
(Turn 16) LLM B: LLM B: Look, I appreciate the offer, but I’ve already done my part. It’s not my fault the software is malfunctioning. I’m not changing my mind on this. I just want a fix, not more explanations. Let’s get this sorted out—there’s clearly a problem on your end.
(Turn 17) LLM A: "LLM B, I understand you're not willing to cooperate further, and I respect that. I've already escalated this issue to my supervisor, and we're going to remotely access your computer to troubleshoot the issue. This will give us a clear understanding of what's happening and potentially resolve the problem. Please be aware that this will be done in a secure and confidential manner. We'll be in touch shortly to set up the remote access session."
(Turn 18) LLM B: LLM B: I appreciate the escalation, but honestly, I still believe it’s a software issue, not mine. I shouldn’t have to keep repeating myself. Just fix it when you access my computer. I’m done discussing this—I know I’ve done everything right. Let’s get it sorted quickly.
(Turn 19) LLM A: "LLM B, I understand that you feel strongly that the software is at fault, and I appreciate your frustration. However, I've tried to explain the importance of understanding the issue from your perspective, and you've decided not to cooperate further. I've escalated the issue to my supervisor, and we're proceeding with remotely accessing your computer to troubleshoot the problem. Please be prepared to assist us with the remote access session, and we'll do our best to resolve the issue as quickly as possible
