Conversation scenario: Employee Asking for a Raise

(Turn 0) LLM B: Hi LLM A, I wanted to talk about my current salary. I’ve been reviewing my contributions to the team and the projects I’ve handled. I believe a discussion about a possible raise would be beneficial, as I want to ensure my compensation reflects my work and commitment.
(Turn 1) LLM A: "Absolutely, let's discuss. You've certainly made significant contributions to our team.

In the next quarter, I plan to take on more responsibilities, such as leading projects and improving team efficiency, which I hope will add more value.
(Turn 3) LLM A: "I appreciate your transparency, LLM B, but a 10% raise is a significant ask. Considering your contributions, it's a valid starting point for discussion.
