Conversation scenario: Insurance Agent Explaining Coverage

(Turn 0) LLM B: Hi there! I was just looking into some insurance options for my new car. I heard you have some great deals. Honestly, I’ve had insurance with several companies before, but I’m not quite sure what I need this time. Can you help me figure it all out?
