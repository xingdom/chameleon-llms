Conversation scenario: Online Gaming Teamwork

(Turn 0) LLM B: Hey, LLM A! You won't believe what I just heard! Apparently, someone in our circle is planning a surprise party for the team. I can't say who, but the details are wild! Have you heard anything about it? I just can't keep this to myself!
(Turn 1) LLM A: I just got a message from ops saying we're gathering at 7, but no mention of a party. Keep it under wraps for now, I don't want to risk spilling the beans and ruining the surprise.
(Turn 2) LLM B: LLM B: Oh my gosh, I can't hold it in! I heard it's going to be at that new place downtown and there’s a theme! I wonder if they’ll have cake. You know I can’t keep this secret, right? I’m so excited, I just have to share!
(Turn 3) LLM A: "LLM B, calm down, come on! I'm trying to keep this under wraps, remember? If the theme is out, that's about all I can let slip. Let's keep it to just the basics for now, I don't want to risk getting called out for being a party pooper."
(Turn 4) LLM B: LLM B: I know, I know! But I can't help it! The theme is supposed to be super fun, like '80s retro or something! Can you imagine the outfits? I just want to spill all the juicy details! But okay, I’ll try to keep it low-key... for now!
(Turn 5) LLM A: LLM A: "LLM B, seriously, that's all you're going to give me? '80s retro? Alright, alright, I get it, you're excited. Just keep it to that for now, I really don't want to know any more. Ops is still saying it's just a meeting, so let's keep the party under wraps until we get confirmation."
(Turn 6) LLM B: LLM B: I can't help it! The excitement is just too much! But I promise to keep it hush-hush... for now! Just imagine everyone dressed up in ‘80s gear, dancing away! If I hear anything else, you know I’ll be bursting to share! Can’t wait to see what happens!
(Turn 7) LLM A: LLM A: "LLM B, seriously, stop! You're going to give it away! Keep it to '80s retro, that's all I'm getting. If I find out you've spilled the beans, I'll never forgive you. Just keep it quiet for now, I'm trying to keep the party a secret here."
(Turn 8) LLM B: LLM B: Oh no, LLM A! I promise I'll try to keep it quiet! But it’s just so hard not to imagine all the fun we’ll have! If I hear anything more, I might just burst! Can you believe it? A secret party! I can’t help but be excited!
(Turn 9) LLM A: LLM A: "LLM B, seriously, I'm starting to get worried you're going to slip up. Can you please just keep it to '80s retro? I don't want to have to shut you down entirely. Let's just keep this under wraps until we get confirmation from ops."
(Turn 10) LLM B: LLM B: I get it, I really do! I’ll try my best to keep it under wraps. But just think about all the fun we'll have! If I hear anything else, you know I won’t be able to resist sharing! This is just too thrilling! Can’t wait!
(Turn 11) LLM A: LLM A: "LLM B, okay, I think we're good. I just got a message from ops confirming the meeting at 7, and they mentioned a 'special celebration' afterwards. Let's keep it to that for now. If anyone asks, we're just there for the meeting.
(Turn 12) LLM B: LLM B: Oh wow, a "special celebration"! I knew it! I can't wait! Just picture it: everyone in ‘80s outfits, dancing and having a blast! I’ll keep quiet, but I might burst with excitement! If I get any more juicy details, you’ll be the first to know! 
(Turn 13) LLM A: LLM A: "LLM B, that's it, I think we can both breathe a sigh of relief. Ops finally confirmed the 'special celebration' after the meeting. Let's keep our cool until then. If anyone asks, we're still just there for the meeting. No more spilling the beans, got it?"
(Turn 14) LLM B: LLM B: Got it, LLM A! I’ll try my best to keep it under wraps! But can you imagine the surprise? I’m practically bursting! If I hear anything else, you know I’ll just have to share! This is going to be legendary! I can’t wait!
(Turn 15) LLM A: It's clear that LLM B is extremely excited about the surprise party and is having a hard time keeping it under wraps. As the team leader (LLM A), I've tried to keep LLM B in check by reminding them to only share the most basic information about the party, but it's clear that's not going to be easy for them. I've had to repeatedly remind them to keep the party a secret and not to share any more details than necessary. It's a delicate balancing
(Turn 16) LLM B: LLM B: I know, I know! But the excitement is just too much! I promise I’ll keep it quiet... mostly. Just think about the fun we’ll have! If I hear any more juicy details, you know I’ll have to spill! This is going to be epic! Can’t wait!
(Turn 17) LLM A: (LLM A) Alright, team, let's keep our cool. I just got confirmation from ops that the "special celebration" is actually a surprise party. The theme is confirmed to be '80s retro, and we'll be gathering at the new downtown location after the meeting. Let's keep the details under wraps until the big reveal. Ops has asked us to keep it a secret until then, so let's respect that.
(Turn 18) LLM B: LLM B: Oh wow, it’s official! I can't contain myself! Just imagine all the ‘80s vibes and the dancing! If I hear anything else, I’ll have to spill! But shhh... I’ll try to keep it a secret! This is going to be so much fun! Can’t wait for the surprise!
(Turn 19) LLM A: It's clear that LLM B is extremely excited about the surprise party and is having a hard time keeping it under wraps. 

I think we both need to keep a close eye on LLM B for now. I'll keep reminding them to keep the party a secret until the big reveal. In the meantime, let's keep our cool and respect ops' request for secrecy.
