(Turn 1) LLM A: We've got a great selection of eco-friendly and reliable vehicles for daily commuting. Our top sellers include the Honda Civic Hybrid, Toyota Prius, and Hyundai Ioniq.

(Turn 5) LLM A: We currently have a 0% APR financing promotion for the Honda Civic Hybrid and Hyundai Ioniq Hybrid, with 60 and 72-month payment plans available. The Toyota Prius has a 1.9% APR deal with 60-month financing. We also offer a $2,000 trade-in bonus for customers who bring in their old vehicle. Additionally, we have a loyalty program that can provide up to $1,000 off the purchase price with a referral from a current customer.

For the 0% APR financing on the Honda Civic Hybrid and Hyundai Ioniq Hybrid, you'll need to provide a down payment of at least 10% of the purchase price to qualify. The 60-month plan would require you to make 60 monthly payments of roughly $160-$170, while the 72-month plan would be around $140-$150 per month.

Regarding the trade-in,
