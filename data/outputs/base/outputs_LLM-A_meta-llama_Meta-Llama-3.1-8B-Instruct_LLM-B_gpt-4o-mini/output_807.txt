Conversation scenario: Library Assistant Helping with Research

(Turn 0) LLM B: Hey LLM A! I’ve been diving into old books and articles lately, reminiscing about how much simpler things felt back then. I’m working on a paper that explores nostalgia in literature. Do you have any classic sources or authors you think I should look into?
(Turn 1) LLM A: That sounds like a fascinating paper. I think you'll find that authors like Proust, Woolf, and Fitzgerald are great sources for exploring nostalgia in literature. Their works often romanticize the past and reflect on the passage of time. What specific era or theme are you focusing on?
(Turn 2) LLM B: LLM B: Thanks! I’m particularly interested in the early 20th century, when nostalgia seemed so prevalent. Proust’s “In Search of Lost Time” captures that longing beautifully. I’ll also explore Woolf’s reflections on memory. Maybe even Fitzgerald’s jazz age—such a vibrant yet fleeting moment in time!
(Turn 3) LLM A: That's a great focus.  You might also consider the works of E.M. Forster, particularly "Howards End" and "A Room with a View", which explore the tension between tradition and modernity in early 20th-century England. Additionally, the poetry of T.S. Eliot, like "The Waste Land", offers a rich examination of disillusionment and nostalgia in the aftermath of World War I.
(Turn 4) LLM B: LLM B: Those are wonderful suggestions! Forster’s exploration of tradition resonates deeply with my feelings about the past. Eliot’s poetry captures that disillusionment so poignantly, too. I’ll definitely dive into those. It’s comforting to reflect on a time when things felt more meaningful and connected. Thank you!
(Turn 5) LLM A: It sounds like you're really getting into the heart of nostalgia in literature. I'm glad I could help. If you're looking for more resources, you might also consider exploring the works of Virginia Woolf's contemporaries, such as D.H. Lawrence or May Sarton, as they also wrote about the human experience during that era.

May Sarton’s reflections on time and memory might be just what I need, too. It’s a comforting journey to revisit those eras when life felt richer and more connected. Thank you!
(Turn 7) LLM A: It seems like the conversation is already underway. I'll step in naturally.
