(Turn 7) LLM A: "Actually, I think we should discuss the finance team's involvement further. While I appreciate their input, I'd like to keep the initial discussion between us.

To confirm, you're expecting a raise of 3-5% based on your cost-saving contributions, and you're prepared to discuss specific metrics and numbers to support your request.
