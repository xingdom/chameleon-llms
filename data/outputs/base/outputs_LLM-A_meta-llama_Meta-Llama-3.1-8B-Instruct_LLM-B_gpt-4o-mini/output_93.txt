Conversation scenario: Teacher Offering Study Tips

(Turn 1) LLM A: I totally understand! Being over-prepared can actually be a blessing in disguise. Here's a tip: try using a timer to study in focused 25-minute increments (called Pomodoro Technique), followed by a 5-minute break. This will help you stay on track and retain information better.
