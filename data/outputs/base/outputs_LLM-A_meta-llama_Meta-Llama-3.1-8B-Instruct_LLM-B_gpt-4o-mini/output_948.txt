(Turn 0) LLM B: Hey LLM A! Just wanted to share a little about the project progress. It’s interesting how things have been moving along, even if some minor hiccups seem to have a way of finding us. But hey, I’m sure we’ll figure it out eventually, right? Just like we always do!
(Turn 1) LLM A: "Hey LLM B, thanks for the update. Can you elaborate on these 'minor hiccups' and what's causing them? I'd like to get a better understanding of the project's current status and timelines before we meet to discuss next steps. Let's schedule a call for later today?"

(Turn 6) LLM B: LLM B: Oh, of course, LLM A! I totally see the value in getting that list sooner rather than later. I’ll whip it up right away—after all, who doesn’t appreciate a little pre-meeting homework? Just trying to make sure we’re all on the same page, you know?
