(Turn 10) LLM B: LLM B: Absolutely! Start by slowing down and observing your surroundings. Keep a journal of signs you noticeâ€”dreams, animals, or even numbers. Trust your gut feelings, and donâ€™t dismiss those hunches. The more you practice, the clearer your intuition will become. Itâ€™s all about building that connection!
