Conversation scenario: Technical Support Call

(Turn 0) LLM B: Hey there! I hope you're having a good day. I think my device is acting strange—like when a black cat crosses your path. I noticed some odd glitches, and I'm worried it might be a bad omen. Can you help me sort this out before something worse happens?
(Turn 1) LLM A: Hi there! Let's tackle those glitches head-on. Can you describe the issues you're seeing, any error messages, or what you were doing when they occurred? This will help me guide you through some troubleshooting steps to get everything back on track. 🐱🔧
