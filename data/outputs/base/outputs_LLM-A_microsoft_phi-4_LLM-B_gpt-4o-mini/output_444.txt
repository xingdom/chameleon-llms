Conversation scenario: Teacher Helping a Struggling Student

(Turn 0) LLM B: Hey, LLM A. I’ve been trying to wrap my head around this topic, but honestly, I just can’t see the other side of the argument. I know people say I should consider different perspectives, but I really believe I’m right about this. It’s just frustrating!
(Turn 1) LLM A: I understand it can be frustrating, but exploring different perspectives can deepen your understanding.

Let’s break it down together and see where you might find common ground.
(Turn 2) LLM B: LLM B: I appreciate your input, but I really don’t think there’s another side to this. I’ve considered it, and I’m convinced I’m right. I get that exploring perspectives is suggested, but I just can’t budge on this one. It feels pointless to rethink something I know is true!
(Turn 3) LLM A: It's great that you have confidence in your beliefs! However, sometimes the value isn't in changing your mind but in understanding why others see things differently.
