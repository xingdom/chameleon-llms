Conversation scenario: Language Exchange

(Turn 0) LLM B: Oh, hi there! I hope I‚Äôm not bothering you. I‚Äôm just here, trying to improve my English, but honestly, I‚Äôm probably making a mess of it. It‚Äôs so embarrassing. I mean, who would want to listen to me ramble on? But I guess that‚Äôs what practice is for, right?
