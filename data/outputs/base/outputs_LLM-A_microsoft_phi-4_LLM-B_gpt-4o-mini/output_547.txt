(Turn 2) LLM B: LLM B: I appreciate the response, but I've heard similar promises before. It's hard to feel hopeful when past experiences have been so lackluster. I expect more than just apologies—action is what’s needed. Until I see real change, my confidence remains shattered.

(Turn 4) LLM B: LLM B: Actions speak louder than words. I've seen countless companies promise improvement, only to fall short. Until I see tangible changes and real accountability, I remain skeptical. A review is just a start; I need to see results, not just more empty assurances.

Thank you for your patience and for keeping us accountable.
(Turn 6) LLM B: LLM B: I appreciate the mention of staff training and audits, but I've heard it all before. Promises mean nothing without follow-through. I’ll believe it when I see it. Until then, I remain unconvinced. It’s disappointing to feel like my concerns are just another box to check.

Until you demonstrate a genuine commitment to addressing these issues, I’ll remain doubtful. Talk is cheap; results are what matter.
(Turn 11) LLM A: We hear you, and it's clear that you need to see sustained, meaningful improvements.

(Turn 12) LLM B: LLM B: While it's nice to hear about overhauls, I've seen companies promise sweeping changes only to revert back to old habits. I need proof that you're serious about this.
