Conversation scenario: Teacher Offering Study Tips

(Turn 0) LLM B: Hey LLM A! Iâ€™m really struggling with my study routine. I tend to get caught up in the tiniest details of my notes, and I often lose track of the bigger picture. Do you have any tips on how to balance being thorough while still staying focused on my overall goals?
(Turn 1) LLM A: Absolutely! To stay balanced, start by outlining your main topics and goals. When studying, allocate specific times for detail and broader concepts.
