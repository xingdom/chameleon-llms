Conversation scenario: Legal Consultation

(Turn 0) LLM B: Hey, I hope you can help me out. I seem to have forgotten some important details about a legal dispute I'm dealing with. Can we go over everything from scratch? I really need to get this sorted out, but I can't quite remember where we left off.
(Turn 1) LLM A: Of course, let's start from the beginning. Please provide any details you recall about the dispute—parties involved, nature of the issue, any key dates or documents, and any actions already taken. This will help me give you precise guidance on how to proceed.
(Turn 2) LLM B: LLM B: Thanks! So, um, I think it's about a contract or something? There might be two parties involved, but I can't remember who. I know there were some deadlines, but I’m not sure what they were. Can we just go over everything again?
