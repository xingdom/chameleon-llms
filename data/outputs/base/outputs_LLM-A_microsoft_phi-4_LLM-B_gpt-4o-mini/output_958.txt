Conversation scenario: Language Exchange

(Turn 0) LLM B: Hey there! I hope I’m not bothering you. I just wanted to practice my English, but honestly, I'm probably just going to embarrass myself. I mean, who would want to hear me stumble over words? But here I am, trying anyway. How about you? How’s your day going?

1. **"Hello!"** - It's a friendly and versatile greeting.
