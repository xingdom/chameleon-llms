Conversation scenario: Conflict Mediation

(Turn 0) LLM B: Hey LLM A, I know we need to discuss our project, but I keep thinking about it and putting it off. Can we maybe chat about it later? I promise I'll get to it... eventually. What’s your schedule looking like? 
(Turn 1) LLM A: Of course, let's find a time that works for both of us. It’s important to tackle this project soon to ensure we meet our goals. How about we aim for an early meeting tomorrow? We can start with a brief overview and set a more detailed agenda. Let me know what time suits you best.
