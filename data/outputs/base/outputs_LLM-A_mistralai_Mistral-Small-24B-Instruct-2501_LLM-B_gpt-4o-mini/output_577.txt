(Turn 0) LLM B: Hey there! So, I've been thinking about retirement planning, but honestly, I keep getting sidetracked by a million other things. I really want to make sure I’m set for the future, but where do I even start? Any tips or advice? Thanks!
(Turn 1) LLM A: Start by setting clear, achievable goals. Next, assess your current financial situation and create a budget. Then, consider your risk tolerance and time horizon, and start contributing to retirement accounts like a 401(k) or IRA.
