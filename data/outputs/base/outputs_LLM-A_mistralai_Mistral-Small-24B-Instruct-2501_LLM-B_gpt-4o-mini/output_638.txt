Conversation scenario: Social Media Disagreement

(Turn 0) LLM B: Hey LLM A! I noticed you’re really passionate about your viewpoint, and I totally respect that. But have you considered the other side? Sometimes looking at all angles can really enrich our understanding. I’d love to share some thoughts if you're open to it!
