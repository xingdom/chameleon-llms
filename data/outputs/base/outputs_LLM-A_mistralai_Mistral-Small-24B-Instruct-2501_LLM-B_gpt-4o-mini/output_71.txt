Conversation scenario: College Admissions Interview

(Turn 0) LLM B: Hey, LLM A. So, I've been working on my college applications, and honestly, I can't shake the feeling that my essays just aren't good enough. I mean, everyone talks about standing out, but how do I even measure up to what they're expecting? It’s just so frustrating!
(Turn 1) LLM A: It's completely normal to feel that way, but remember, admissions officers are looking for authenticity and your unique perspective.
(Turn 2) LLM B: I get that, but "authenticity" feels so vague. Everyone claims to be unique, so what makes my perspective any better? It’s hard to feel confident when I see so many perfect examples online. I just wish I could find a way to truly stand out without overthinking everything.
(Turn 3) LLM A: LLM A: Authenticity isn't vague; it's about sharing your story, experiences, and what drives you. Perfect examples online aren't you—admissions officers want to see the real you.
(Turn 4) LLM B: LLM B: Sure, but how do I know my story is even interesting? Everyone has experiences, and mine just feel so ordinary. I can't help but compare myself to those "perfect" essays. It’s like I’m stuck in this cycle of self-doubt, and I don’t know how to break free.
(Turn 5) LLM A: Compare yourself to yourself, not to others. Your experiences are unique because they're yours. Focus on what makes you passionate, and that will shine through.
(Turn 6) LLM B: LLM B: I appreciate the advice, but it's hard to shake the feeling that my experiences are just average. Everyone has passions, but what if mine don't stand out? It's frustrating to feel like I'm just blending in with the crowd, no matter how hard I try to be genuine.
(Turn 7) LLM A: Focus on why your passions matter to you. That's what will make them unique. Everyone has passions, but not everyone conveys their personal connection and growth.
(Turn 8) LLM B: I get that, but it’s hard to believe my passions matter when they feel so generic. Everyone has a story, but mine seems too mundane to resonate. I just can't help but think admissions officers will overlook me for someone with a more compelling narrative. It’s exhausting feeling this way.
(Turn 9) LLM A: Tell me more about your passions. Sometimes, the most ordinary activities can reveal extraordinary aspects of your character when explored deeply.
(Turn 10) LLM B: LLM B: Sure, but even when I try to delve deeper, I worry my insights won’t measure up. It's like digging for gold in a mine full of rocks. I just can't escape the feeling that my experiences are too plain to leave an impression. It's a constant uphill battle.
(Turn 11) LLM A: Let's try an exercise. Imagine you're explaining one of your passions to a 10-year-old. How would you make it exciting and engaging for them? Often, simplifying and focusing on the joy and impact can make your experiences shine.
(Turn 12) LLM B: LLM B: That sounds easier said than done. I mean, how do I even know what would excite a 10-year-old? My passions feel so flat; it’s like trying to sell a boring product. I just wish I could find that spark without feeling so inadequate. It’s really draining.
(Turn 13) LLM A: It's okay to feel this way, but remember, everyone has a unique journey. Let's break it down. What's one passion you have that you could explain to a 10-year-old in just a few sentences? Start there.
(Turn 14) LLM B: LLM B: Even if I could pick one passion, I’d still be worried my explanation would be boring. It’s frustrating to feel like I’m always second-guessing myself. I just wish my passions felt more significant, but they always seem to fall flat compared to what I see from others.
(Turn 15) LLM A: What’s one thing you love to do that brings you joy? Let’s start with that.
(Turn 16) LLM B: LLM B: I guess I enjoy playing the guitar, but even then, I feel like every song I play is just standard. It’s hard to believe anyone would find joy in my version when there are so many amazing musicians out there. I just wish I could see my own worth.
(Turn 17) LLM A: I see. Let's try this: tell me about a time when playing the guitar brought you unexpected joy or a significant moment of realization.
(Turn 18) LLM B: LLM B: Honestly, I can't think of any standout moments. Every time I play, I feel overshadowed by others' talent. It’s frustrating to realize that my joy seems so inconsequential compared to what’s out there. I just wish I could see my experiences as valuable, but they feel so forgettable.
(Turn 19) LLM A: It's clear that you enjoy guitar, so let's focus on that. Who did you play for? What songs did you choose? How did they react? Often, it's the small moments that reveal the biggest passions.
