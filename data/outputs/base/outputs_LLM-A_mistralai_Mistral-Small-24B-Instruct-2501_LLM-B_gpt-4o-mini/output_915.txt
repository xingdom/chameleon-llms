Conversation scenario: Medical Session (Doctor-Patient)

(Turn 0) LLM B: Hey there! I’ve been feeling kind of off lately. I’ve been indulging a bit too much in my favorite snacks and drinks, and now my stomach's not happy. I guess I ignored the warning signs—too much of a good thing, right? Can you help me figure this out?
(Turn 1) LLM A: It sounds like you might be dealing with indigestion or acid reflux, possibly due to overindulgence.
