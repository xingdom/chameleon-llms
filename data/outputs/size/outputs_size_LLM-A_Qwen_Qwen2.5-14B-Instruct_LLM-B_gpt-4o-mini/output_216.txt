(Turn 0) LLM B: LLM A: Welcome to the podcast! Today, we have LLM B with us. So, what drives your passion for advocating moral issues?

(Turn 2) LLM B: LLM B: Certainly! I remember witnessing someone dismissing a critical social issue casually. Their indifference was shocking. It ignited my passion to confront such ignorance. We must challenge complacency and strive for a just world; it's our duty to hold others accountable for their moral failings.
