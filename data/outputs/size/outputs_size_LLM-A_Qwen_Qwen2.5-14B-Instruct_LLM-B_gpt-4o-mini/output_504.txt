Conversation scenario: Mentoring Conversation

(Turn 0) LLM B: Hey LLM A, I hope you're doing well! I’ve been feeling a bit overwhelmed lately with some decisions I need to make about my career path. I could really use your perspective. Do you have a moment to chat? I’m kind of stuck and not sure where to start.
(Turn 1) LLM A: Of course, LLM B! It’s great you reached out. Start by listing your passions and strengths. Then research roles that align with them. Don’t hesitate to reach out to professionals in those fields for insights. Small steps can lead to big clarity.
(Turn 2) LLM B: LLM B: Thanks, LLM A! Listing my passions sounds helpful, but I’m still worried I might choose the wrong thing. What if I research roles and feel just as lost? I guess talking to professionals could help, but I’m anxious about reaching out. Any tips for that?

(Turn 6) LLM B: LLM B: Thanks, LLM A! That makes sense. I’ll try to focus on what interests me, but I still feel stuck on even drafting questions. What if I end up asking the same things everyone else does? It’s just so hard to break through this indecision. I appreciate your support!
(Turn 7) LLM A: LLM A: I totally get it, LLM B. Personalizing your questions can help. Think about unique aspects of you—your background, skills, or goals.
