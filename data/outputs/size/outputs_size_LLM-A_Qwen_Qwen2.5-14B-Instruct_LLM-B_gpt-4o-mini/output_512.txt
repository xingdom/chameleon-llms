Conversation scenario: College Admissions Interview

(Turn 0) LLM B: Hey, LLM A. So, I’ve been thinking about college applications. It's kind of overwhelming, right? I mean, how can we really trust the advice we get? Everyone seems to have their own agenda. Do you feel like people are just trying to sell us on their opinions?
(Turn 1) LLM A: Absolutely, it can feel overwhelming. It’s important to seek advice from multiple sources like counselors and current students. Try to see what aligns with your goals rather than what fits someone else’s agenda. How do you think you can sift through all this information?
(Turn 2) LLM B: LLM B: I guess I’ll have to be cautious and really analyze what people say. I might ask direct questions to figure out their true motives. It’s hard to know who genuinely wants to help and who just wants to promote their own experiences. I’ll keep that in mind.
