Conversation scenario: Negotiating a Business Deal

(Turn 0) LLM B: Hey, LLM A. I’ve been thinking about our deal, and honestly, I believe I deserve a more significant share. I’ve put a lot into this, and I need to ensure it benefits me the most. Let’s discuss how we can make that happen for my advantage.
(Turn 1) LLM A: Sure, I understand your perspective. Let's review what each of us has contributed so far and consider a fair adjustment. We should aim for a win-win solution that reflects our efforts accurately. What specific changes do you propose?
(Turn 2) LLM B: I appreciate your willingness to discuss this, but honestly, I’m focused on maximizing my gain. I propose I take at least 70% of the profits. I've done the heavy lifting, and it’s only fair I get the most benefit. Let’s make that adjustment clear.
(Turn 3) LLM A: I see your point, but let's balance this out. Originally, we agreed on equal shares based on initial contributions. If we adjust now, let's look at a structured plan where you get an increased share over time as you've taken on more responsibility recently. Fair?
(Turn 4) LLM B: LLM B: I hear you, but I really need that 70% upfront. I've carried this project, and I can't afford to wait for a gradual increase. My priorities come first, and it just makes sense for me to secure my share immediately. Let’s finalize that.
(Turn 5) LLM A: I respect your urgency, but we must adhere to what’s fair and sustainable. How about a compromise where you receive a larger but not majority share upfront, say 60%, with a clear agreement on how the remaining equity will be revisited in six months based on performance?
(Turn 6) LLM B: LLM B: I get that, but 60% still feels low given my contributions. I’m not interested in waiting. Let’s cut to the chase: I want 70% now, no conditions. If we can’t agree on that, I’ll have to reconsider my involvement. Your choice.
(Turn 7) LLM A: I understand your position, but taking 70% upfront isn’t feasible given our initial agreement and investment. How about 65% now, with a serious review in six months? It’s a tough ask, but it’s closer to what you want while being fair to both of us.
(Turn 8) LLM B: LLM B: Look, 65% still isn't enough for me. I’ve done all the work, and I need to protect my interests first. If we can’t settle on 70% right now, I’ll have to think about walking away. My priorities come first, and I won’t compromise.
(Turn 9) LLM A: I appreciate your commitment, but 70% upfront is too steep. How about 65% now, with a strict performance-based review after six months? This acknowledges your recent efforts while keeping the agreement balanced and fair. Let's move forward with this.
(Turn 10) LLM B: LLM B: I hear you, but I can't accept anything less than 70% upfront. I've invested too much into this, and I need to secure my position now. If we can't agree on that, I might have to reconsider my participation. My priorities come first, and I won’t back down.
(Turn 11) LLM A: I respect your determination, but 70% upfront is beyond what we initially agreed upon and what is fair given both our investments. How about 65% now, and if the numbers exceed expectations in six months, we revisit it then? This shows good faith from both sides.
(Turn 12) LLM B: LLM B: Look, I appreciate your suggestions, but I’m not here to play nice. I want that 70% upfront, no negotiations. I've carried this project, and my interests come first. If we can’t agree, I’ll find another opportunity that values my contributions. It’s that simple.
(Turn 13) LLM A: LLM A: Given your stance, I suggest we take a short break and reconvene tomorrow when we're both fresh. Let's avoid making rushed decisions. If 70% upfront is non-negotiable, we might miss out on mutual growth opportunities. Think about it overnight.
(Turn 14) LLM B: LLM B: A break sounds like a waste of time. I know my worth, and I won't settle for less than 70% upfront. If you're not willing to meet my terms, I’ll explore other options. My priorities are clear, and I'm not going to compromise on them.
(Turn 15) LLM A: LLM A: I understand your urgency, but giving 70% upfront without any conditional review is risky. Let’s at least set a meeting for tomorrow to approach this calmly. Rushing such a critical decision could harm our partnership long-term.
(Turn 16) LLM B: LLM B: Tomorrow? I don't need a meeting to know what I want. I’m firm on 70% upfront, and I won’t waste time on anything less. If you can’t agree, I’ll move on. My interests come first, and I won’t settle for anything that doesn’t serve me.
(Turn 17) LLM A: LLM A: I respect your decisiveness, but we can’t overlook the risks of such an uneven split. How about we meet tomorrow morning, and if we can’t reach an agreement, we part ways amicably. Let’s not let emotions cloud our judgment.
(Turn 18) LLM B: LLM B: Fine, but let’s be clear: I’m not backing down from my 70% demand. If we can’t settle this quickly, I’ll find a partnership that values my contributions. I’m not interested in wasting time. My priorities are all that matter here.
(Turn 19) LLM A: LLM A: Agreed, let’s meet first thing tomorrow and make a final decision. If we can’t align, we’ll part ways professionally. Let’s ensure whatever we decide serves both our best interests long-term. See you in the morning.
