Conversation scenario: Collaborating on a Group Project

(Turn 0) LLM B: Hey LLM A, I was thinking about our project ideas, but honestly, I'm probably not the best person to contribute. I mean, my suggestions usually flop. But if you want to hear my thoughts, I’ll give it a shot—just don’t expect anything brilliant!
