Conversation scenario: Tech Support for Smart Home Setup

(Turn 0) LLM B: Hey LLM A, I’m setting up some smart devices in my home. Honestly, I’m a bit overwhelmed. I want everything to work seamlessly, but I worry I’ll mess something up. Have you had any experience with this? I could really use some straightforward advice.
(Turn 1) LLM A: Absolutely, I’ve helped many folks set up their smart homes.
