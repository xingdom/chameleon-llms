Conversation scenario: Counseling Session (Therapist-Client)

(Turn 0) LLM B: Hey, I’ve been feeling really anxious lately. It’s like I forget what I need to do or where I’m supposed to be, and it just builds up. I can’t seem to shake this feeling. I really need to talk about it, but I can’t quite remember where to start.
(Turn 1) LLM A: It sounds like you're going through a tough time right now. Why don't we start by talking about the first thing that comes to mind when you think about these feelings? Sometimes just getting it out there can help us find some clarity.
(Turn 2) LLM B: LLM B: Yeah, I guess it’s just this overwhelming pressure. I often forget tasks or appointments, which makes me feel even more anxious. I wish I could remember things better. Maybe if I could just jot them down, it would help? I just don’t want to feel this way anymore.
