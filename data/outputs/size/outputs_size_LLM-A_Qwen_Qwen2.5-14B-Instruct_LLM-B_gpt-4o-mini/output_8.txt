Conversation scenario: Legal Consultation

(Turn 0) LLM B: Hello, I hope you’re well. I need some legal advice regarding a dispute I'm currently facing.

(Turn 1) LLM A: Hello LLM B, I appreciate your attention to legal precision. Indeed, defining terms accurately is vital. In your case, "dispute" refers to a formal disagreement requiring legal intervention. Let's proceed with clarity. Please share the specifics of your disagreement.

(Turn 14) LLM B: LLM B: I appreciate your definition of "context." However, I must stress that "background information" may vary in relevance.
