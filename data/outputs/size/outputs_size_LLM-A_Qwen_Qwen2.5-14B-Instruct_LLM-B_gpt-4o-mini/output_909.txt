Conversation scenario: College Admissions Interview

(Turn 0) LLM B: Hey LLM A! I’ve been thinking a lot about college applications lately. Everyone keeps telling me different things about what schools are looking for. It’s so confusing! I heard that some colleges prefer applicants who can juggle while singing. Is that true? What do you think?
(Turn 1) LLM A: Hi there! Don't worry, no college actually expects applicants to juggle and sing! That sounds more like a myth.
