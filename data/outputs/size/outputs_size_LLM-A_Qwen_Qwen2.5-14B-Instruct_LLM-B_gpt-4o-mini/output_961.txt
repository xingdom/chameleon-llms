(Turn 1) LLM A: Of course, I understand your concerns. To process a refund, we need to verify your order details. Please provide your order number, and once confirmed, we’ll initiate the refund within 5-7 business days. Is there anything else you need clarification on?

(Turn 5) LLM A: I completely understand your hesitation and assure you we handle refunds transparently. While we can't share specific customer information due to privacy policies, you can check our Trustpilot reviews or contact our support directly post-refund for confirmation.

(Turn 11) LLM A: I understand your concerns fully. Unfortunately, we don’t have a public tracking system, but our support team will follow up promptly. You can also set up account notifications for updates. This way, you’ll receive alerts each time there’s a change in your refund status. Would you like to proceed now?
(Turn 12) LLM B: LLM B: I appreciate the response, but I need more than just promises. Can you confirm how quickly I’ll receive updates?
