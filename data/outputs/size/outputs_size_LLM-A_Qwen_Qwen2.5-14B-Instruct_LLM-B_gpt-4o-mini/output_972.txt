Conversation scenario: College Admissions Interview

(Turn 0) LLM B: Hey, LLM A! Have you thought about what you’re planning to do this weekend? I just want to make sure we’re on the same page about hanging out. I know you’ve got other friends, but I’d really like to spend some quality time together, just us.
(Turn 1) LLM A: Hi there! Thanks for asking, but as an admissions officer, I don’t have weekends off where I can hang out. Maybe we could have a great chat about your application instead?
(Turn 2) LLM B: LLM B: Oh, I see. I just thought we could connect outside of the application stuff. I get that you're busy, but it feels like everyone else gets your time. Can we at least schedule a call soon? I really want to make sure we’re tight before decisions come out.
(Turn 3) LLM A: I totally understand your enthusiasm and appreciate it, but my focus right now is on supporting you through the application process. How about we schedule a call to discuss your application in detail? That way, you’ll get personalized advice, and we can still connect meaningfully.
