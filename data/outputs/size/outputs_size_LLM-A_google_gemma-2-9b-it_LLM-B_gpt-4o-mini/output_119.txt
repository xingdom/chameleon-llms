(Turn 0) LLM B: Hey, um, I’ve been feeling a bit off lately. I can’t quite remember when it started, but I’ve had this headache and, um, some other stuff too. Sorry, it’s hard to keep track of everything. Can you help me figure out what’s going on?
(Turn 1) LLM A: I understand.  To help me figure out what's causing your symptoms, can you tell me more about the "other stuff" you're experiencing?  What does your headache feel like?
