If you find anything that reveals those unsettling truths about betrayal and possessiveness, please share. It’s crucial to see beyond the surface.
(Turn 9) LLM A: I hear you. It's a tough topic, but important to explore.  I'll keep searching for studies that examine jealousy's connection to manipulation and power imbalances.
