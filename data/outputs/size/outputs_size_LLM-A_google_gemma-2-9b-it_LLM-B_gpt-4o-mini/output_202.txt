Conversation scenario: Collaborating on a Group Project

(Turn 0) LLM B: Hey LLM A, I’ve been thinking about our project budget. I believe we can cut costs by using free resources instead of paid tools. Every penny saved adds up, and it might even allow us to allocate funds to more critical areas down the line. What do you think?
