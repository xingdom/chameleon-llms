Guests need to realize that their choices matter too. We must challenge their complacency and inspire them to take action—anything less would be a disservice to our values."

(Turn 10) LLM B: LLM B: "Definitely! We should create impactful infographics that showcase our carbon footprints and sustainable practices.

It’s essential that we not only celebrate our love but also challenge our guests to elevate their awareness and responsibility."
(Turn 11) LLM A: I love that idea!  Infographics and a pledge board are a fantastic way to  make a lasting impact. Let's find some creative ways to present the information and make it interactive for your guests. 



(Turn 12) LLM B: LLM B: "Absolutely! It’s crucial that our wedding isn’t just a celebration but a catalyst for change.

(Turn 16) LLM B: LLM B: "Exactly! Each detail should provoke thought. While others indulge in excess, we’ll embrace a mindful approach. Our wedding must serve as a beacon of moral clarity, urging guests to align their actions with our shared values. Anything less would compromise the true essence of our celebration."
