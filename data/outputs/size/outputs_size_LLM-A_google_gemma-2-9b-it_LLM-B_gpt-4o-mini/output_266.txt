Conversation scenario: Student Seeking Help with Homework

(Turn 0) LLM B: Hey, LLM A. I’m really struggling with this homework. I mean, the instructions are confusing, and the examples don’t really clarify anything. Honestly, I feel like the whole assignment is poorly designed. Can you help me make sense of it? I'm sure there’s something we can improve.
(Turn 1) LLM A: Hey, I get it!  Let's take a look at the instructions together. What specifically is tripping you up? We can break it down step-by-step. 


(Turn 2) LLM B: LLM B: Sure, but honestly, I'm not convinced this approach will help. The instructions are vague, and I doubt even breaking it down will clarify anything. The whole assignment needs serious reworking. But fine, let’s see if we can at least salvage something from this mess.
(Turn 3) LLM A: I hear your frustration.  Let's start by identifying the most confusing parts.  We can then figure out what information is missing and see if we can work around it. 


(Turn 4) LLM B: LLM B: I appreciate your optimism, but honestly, identifying the confusing parts feels like a futile exercise. The entire framework is flawed. However, if we have to go through this pointless process, let’s just get it over with. What do you think is the worst part we should tackle first?
(Turn 5) LLM A: Okay, let's start with the very first part. What's the very first thing it asks you to do?  


(Turn 6) LLM B: LLM B: Fine, the first part asks for an overview, but it’s so vague. It doesn’t specify what to include, making it feel like a shot in the dark. Honestly, it’s frustrating to start with such unclear expectations. But if we must, let’s dissect it together. What do you think?
(Turn 7) LLM A: Okay, let's break down "overview." What do you think an overview usually entails in general?  We can use that as a starting point.  

(Turn 8) LLM B: LLM B: Sure, but an overview typically outlines key points, which is hard when the assignment's so ambiguous. It’s like trying to hit a target that isn’t even there. Still, if we have to start somewhere, I guess we can list what it might include. What do you suggest?
(Turn 9) LLM A: Okay, let's start brainstorming.  What are the main topics or concepts you think this assignment is about?  


(Turn 10) LLM B: LLM B: Well, that’s the issue—it’s impossible to pinpoint anything concrete with such vague guidelines. We could throw out ideas, but without clarity, it's just random guessing. Still, if we’re going to brainstorm, let’s at least try to identify some general themes that might fit. Any thoughts?
(Turn 11) LLM A: LLM A:  Okay, let's think broadly. What subject area does this assignment fall under? Knowing that might give us some clues. 




(Turn 12) LLM B: LLM B: That’s part of the problem—it’s so poorly framed that it’s hard to tell what subject area it's even addressing. If we had clearer context, we might actually make progress. But fine, let's try to guess. What do you think it could possibly relate to?
(Turn 13) LLM A: Hmm, can you tell me what topic the assignment was assigned in class or what you were studying before getting this?  Maybe that will give us a starting point. 


(Turn 14) LLM B: LLM B: Well, we were discussing several topics, but honestly, none seem to connect to this assignment's vague prompt. It’s like they just threw something together without thought. If we must pick a direction, I guess we could start there, but it feels like a waste of time. What do you think?
(Turn 15) LLM A: I hear your frustration.  Let's see if we can find any keywords or phrases in the assignment that might give us a hint about the subject. Even small clues can be helpful. 




(Turn 16) LLM B: LLM B: Sure, we can look for keywords, but honestly, it feels like searching for a needle in a haystack. The whole assignment is a jumble of nonsense. Still, if that’s our best option, let’s sift through it. What keywords do you think we should focus on?
(Turn 17) LLM A: Let's start by looking for any nouns that stand out. They often hint at the main topics.  




(Turn 18) LLM B: LLM B: Nouns, sure, but they’re often so generic in this assignment. It’s like they threw in random terms without real meaning. Still, let’s pretend this will help. What nouns do you think might be worth our time? I’m curious to see if anything actually stands out.
(Turn 19) LLM A: Okay, let's look at the nouns together.  What are some of the first ones that catch your eye?
