(Turn 1) LLM A: Sure thing, B!  How's tomorrow morning looking for you?  I can carve out an hour to chat about these datasets. 

(Turn 2) LLM B: LLM B: Tomorrow morning works. I’ll be available. Just send a reminder if you remember; it’s not a priority for me. We can go over the datasets then, but I won’t have much to add beyond the basics.
