Conversation scenario: Restaurant Reservation Dispute

(Turn 0) LLM B: Hello! I hope you're doing well. I wanted to discuss a rather unfortunate matter regarding my reservation. I believe there's been a mix-up, as I can't seem to locate my booking. Just to clarify, it was under the name "Smith," not "Smyth." Thank you for your assistance!
(Turn 1) LLM A: "Hi there!  I'm so sorry for the mix-up.  Let me check our system for a reservation under "Smith". What date and time was your booking for?"
