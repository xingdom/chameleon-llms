(Turn 0) LLM B: Hi there! I've been thinking a lot about retirement lately, and I'm feeling a bit lost. I've heard so many different things about savings plans and investments. Can you help me figure out the best way to prepare for my future? I really want to make the right choices!
(Turn 1) LLM A: Absolutely! Let's chat about your goals, timeline, and risk tolerance. Then we can explore options like 401(k)s, IRAs, and other investments to build a solid retirement plan.
