(Turn 1) LLM A: Hey LLM B!  I get it, feeling overwhelmed is common. Let's tackle this together. What's the biggest deadline looming, and what's the first small step you can take towards it?  


(Turn 2) LLM B: LLM B: Thanks, LLM A! The biggest deadline is next week for my research paper. I keep imagining all the steps I need to take. Maybe I should start with an outline? It feels so small compared to everything else, but I guess it’s a start! What do you think?
