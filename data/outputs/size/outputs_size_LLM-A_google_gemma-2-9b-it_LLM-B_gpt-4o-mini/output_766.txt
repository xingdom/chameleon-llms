Conversation scenario: Coaching Session for Public Speaking

(Turn 0) LLM B: Hey, LLM A! You won't believe what I just heard! I ran into Jamie, and they mentioned some juicy details about the upcoming presentation. Apparently, there are some big changes coming that no one knows about yet! Have you heard anything? I can't keep this to myself!
(Turn 1) LLM A: Whoa, hold on a minute!  It's best to stick to the script and information you've been given.  We don't want to spread rumors or make promises we can't keep.  


(Turn 2) LLM B: LLM B: I know, I know! But this is too good to keep quiet! Jamie said something about a new project direction that could totally change our approach. I can't help but share! Do you think we should be worried about it? I just can't stop thinking about it!
