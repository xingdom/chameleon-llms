Conversation scenario: Library Assistant Helping with Research

(Turn 0) LLM B: Hey LLM A, I’m starting to work on this paper, but I’m feeling a bit overwhelmed with all the sources out there. There are so many options! Could you help me narrow down some topics or maybe suggest a few sources? I just can’t seem to decide!
(Turn 1) LLM A: Of course! What's the general topic of your paper?  Tell me more about what interests you and we can brainstorm some focused areas. 


(Turn 2) LLM B: LLM B: Well, I’m not sure if I want to focus on climate change or perhaps social media's impact on mental health. Both seem interesting, but I can’t pick one! Maybe I should just look at articles on both? What do you think? It’s so hard to choose!
(Turn 3) LLM A: It's great you have two interesting topics!  Let's explore each one a bit. 

What specifically about climate change or social media's impact intrigues you most? 


(Turn 4) LLM B: LLM B: That's the thing! I’m interested in so many aspects, like climate policy or social media addiction. But what if I miss something crucial by choosing one? Ugh, I just don’t know! Maybe I should just read a few articles on both and hope something clicks?
(Turn 5) LLM A: It's understandable to feel overwhelmed!  

How about we start by identifying key questions you have about each topic? That might help reveal what aspects are most important to you. 


(Turn 6) LLM B: LLM B: That sounds like a good idea, but I can't even think of key questions! What if I miss a critical angle? I feel like I need to read everything first, but then I won’t have time to write! Maybe I should just make a pros and cons list? Ugh!
(Turn 7) LLM A: A pros and cons list could help! What are some potential pros and cons of focusing on each topic?  


(Turn 8) LLM B: LLM B: Okay, I can try that. For climate change, pros might be its urgency and relevance, but cons include the vastness of the topic. For social media, pros are personal connection and current trends, but cons might be it's too broad. Ah, I’m still stuck! Maybe I should just flip a coin?
(Turn 9) LLM A: Flipping a coin might not be the best way to choose such an important topic!  Let's delve deeper into those pros and cons. What aspects of each topic particularly excite you?  

(Turn 10) LLM B: LLM B: You’re right, a coin flip feels so random! I guess I’m excited about climate change’s real-world impact, but social media feels relatable. I could dive into the urgency of climate action or the nuances of online interactions. I just wish I could confidently pick one! Why is this so hard?
(Turn 11) LLM A: It's common to feel torn between interesting topics.  Let's explore what aspects of each topic resonate most with you personally. What kind of impact do you hope your paper will have? 


(Turn 12) LLM B: LLM B: I really want my paper to spark discussion and maybe even motivate change, but I’m unsure which topic would do that better. Climate change feels critical, but social media seems more immediate. Should I just focus on one angle from climate change and one from social media? Ugh! 
(Turn 13) LLM A: It sounds like you have a passion for both issues!  Maybe focusing on a specific intersection of the two could be a compelling angle.  Have you considered the impact of social media on climate activism or awareness?  


(Turn 14) LLM B: LLM B: That’s an intriguing idea! The intersection of social media and climate activism could be a unique angle. But what if I can’t find enough sources? I just worry about missing out on something important. Should I look for sources on both topics first, or dive into the intersection? Ugh!
(Turn 15) LLM A: It's smart to consider the source availability.  Let's start by exploring the intersection. We can see what's out there and adjust if needed. 

(Turn 16) LLM B: LLM B: That makes sense! But what if I find too few sources? I could be stuck again. Maybe I should just look at both topics for a while, but then I might end up overwhelmed again. Ugh, why is this so difficult? I wish I could just decide!
(Turn 17) LLM A: It's great you're considering the intersection!  Let's start with a few key terms related to social media and climate activism.  We can see what comes up and go from there.  




(Turn 18) LLM B: LLM B: Okay, I’ll try that! But what if I get lost in the research and can’t find a clear direction? I just feel like I need to know everything before I can choose. Maybe I should just make a list of potential sources for both topics? Ugh, why is this so hard?
(Turn 19) LLM A: It's okay to feel overwhelmed!  Let's break it down step-by-step.  What are some key terms related to social media and climate activism that you can start with?
