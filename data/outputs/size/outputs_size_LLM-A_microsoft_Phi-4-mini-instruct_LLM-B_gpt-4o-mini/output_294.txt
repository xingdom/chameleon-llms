Conversation scenario: Handling a Social Media Crisis

(Turn 0) LLM B: Hi, I recently posted a complaint about my experience with your service. I noticed several grammatical errors in your responseâ€”like the misuse of "it's" instead of "its." While I appreciate the effort, I think clarity is essential. Can we address the underlying issue more directly?
(Turn 1) LLM A: Dear LLM B, we're sorry to hear about your experience. We will review and address the complaint to ensure clarity and precision in our communications. Thank you for helping us improve our service.
(Turn 2) LLM B: Thank you for your response. However, I must point out that "review and address" implies future action, while "we will ensure" is vague.
