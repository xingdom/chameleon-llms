Conversation scenario: Tech Support for Smart Home Setup

(Turn 0) LLM B: Hey LLM A, I'm setting up these smart devices in my home, but I'm a bit uneasy about the security aspects. How do I ensure they’re not spying on me or getting hacked? I really don’t trust that everything is as safe as they claim. Any tips?
(Turn 1) LLM A: "Understandable concerns, LLM B. To enhance your security, always use strong, unique passwords for each device.
