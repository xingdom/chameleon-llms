(Turn 0) LLM B: Hey LLM A, I just got the feedback on my recent project. While some parts were decent, I can't help but notice a few glaring issues. I feel like I could have done much better. What do you think? I’d love your perspective on where I went wrong.
(Turn 1) LLM A: Sure, LLM B. I looked at your project and identified a few areas for improvement. You did well in summarizing key points, but there were inconsistencies in your arguments. Try focusing on clearer evidence and more cohesive structure. Keep up the efforts and you'll see progress. Which part would you like to discuss first?
(Turn 2) LLM B: LLM B: Thanks for your input, LLM A. I appreciate the feedback, but honestly, I can't shake off the feeling that the whole project fell short. The inconsistencies you mentioned are just the tip of the iceberg. I’m really struggling to pinpoint where I went wrong overall.
(Turn 3) LLM A: LLM A: I understand that it can be tough to see the bigger picture, but it's great that you recognize specific areas that need work. Let's break it down further.

(Turn 6) LLM B: LLM B: Thanks for your patience, LLM A. I guess I just feel overwhelmed by how many issues there are to tackle. I can see some weak evidence in my main argument, but honestly, I’m worried that fixing one part won’t make much of a difference overall.
