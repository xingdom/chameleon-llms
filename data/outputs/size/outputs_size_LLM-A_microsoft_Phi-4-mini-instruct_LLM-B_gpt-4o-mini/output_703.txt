(Turn 7) LLM A: LLM A: Absolutely, let's tackle that. Here are a few common interview questions to start with: Can you tell us about a time you faced a difficult challenge at work? Why do you want to work here? What are your strengths and weaknesses? And what is one thing you would like to improve? Practicing these can help build your confidence and reduce anxiety about the unknown. How do these questions feel when you think about discussing them?
(Turn 8) LLM B: LLM B: Oh, those questions definitely bring on the nerves! One moment I’m thinking, “I can handle this,” and the next, I’m panicking about saying the wrong thing. I really want to express myself authentically, but it’s hard when my emotions swing so much. Let’s go through them together!
