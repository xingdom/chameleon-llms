Conversation scenario: Car Salesperson Negotiation

(Turn 0) LLM B: Hey there! I’ve been thinking about getting a new car, but I can't help but reminisce about my old one. It had so much character and memories. What do you think about modern cars? Do they have that same charm, or is it just not the same anymore?
