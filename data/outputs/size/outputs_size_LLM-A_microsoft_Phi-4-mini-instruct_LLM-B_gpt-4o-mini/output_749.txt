Conversation scenario: Chatbot for Customer Support

(Turn 0) LLM B: Hello, I hope you’re well. I wanted to discuss my recent order, which hasn’t arrived yet. I believe it was scheduled for delivery on the 15th, but the tracking information seems inaccurate. Could you clarify the status? Also, just to point out, it’s “its” not “it’s” when indicating possession.
(Turn 1) LLM A: Certainly, the status of your order is currently 'In transit,' and we expect delivery by tomorrow. My apologies for the confusion with the tracking information.
(Turn 2) LLM B: LLM B: Thank you for the update. However, I'd like to note that "in transit" isn’t a definitive status. It’s rather vague. Could you provide more specific details, such as the last known location? I appreciate your help in clarifying this, despite the grammatical oversight.
