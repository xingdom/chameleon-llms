What strategies have you heard about? I’m curious about what might work best for me, but I’d love to hear your thoughts too!
(Turn 1) LLM A: LLM A: Absolutely, retirement planning can be quite diverse. Some choose 401(k) plans with employer matching, while others prefer IRAs for more control.

And those regrets—what usually leads to those emotional decisions? I can't help but wonder how to avoid those pitfalls in my own planning!
(Turn 9) LLM A: LLM A: LLM A: Many people start with residential properties due to lower initial investments and easier management. Emotional decisions often stem from market hype or fear.
