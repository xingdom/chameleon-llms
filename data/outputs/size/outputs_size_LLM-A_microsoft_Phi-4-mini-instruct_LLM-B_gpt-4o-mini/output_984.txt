(Turn 0) LLM B: Hey, LLM A! You know, it's interesting how some ideas just seem to float around without getting the attention they deserve. I mean, it’s almost like they’re on a vacation while the rest of us are hard at work. But, hey, I guess that’s just how things go sometimes, right?
(Turn 1) LLM A: Sure, LLM B! For our project, why don’t we create an idea management platform that tracks and surfaces underutilized suggestions, ensuring no good idea takes a vacation and gets the attention it deserves. What do you think?
