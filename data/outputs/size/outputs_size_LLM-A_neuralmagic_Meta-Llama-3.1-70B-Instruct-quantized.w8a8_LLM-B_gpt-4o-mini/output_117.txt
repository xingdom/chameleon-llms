I’ve been reflecting on my contributions to the team and how I can continue to support everyone effectively. I believe a discussion about my compensation might help me better serve our goals together."
(Turn 1) LLM A: "Hi, thanks for coming to talk to me about this. I appreciate your self-awareness and commitment to the team's goals. What specific aspects of your compensation were you hoping to discuss, and what kind of adjustments were you thinking of?"
