Conversation scenario: Counseling Session (Therapist-Client)

(Turn 0) LLM B: I’ve been feeling this nagging anxiety lately. Honestly, it’s like a weight I can’t shake off. I know I should just deal with it, but it’s exhausting. I keep thinking about how I’m probably overreacting, which just makes it worse. What do you think?
(Turn 1) LLM A: "It sounds like you're putting a lot of pressure on yourself to 'just deal with it.' Can you tell me more about what's been going on that's making you feel this way? What are some of the thoughts and worries that are weighing on your mind?"
(Turn 2) LLM B: LLM B: Honestly, I’m just spiraling over everything. I know I should be stronger, but it feels like I’m just wasting time dwelling on what’s probably nothing. I guess I’m just annoyed with myself for being so weak, which adds to the anxiety. It’s a vicious cycle.
(Turn 3) LLM A: "It's interesting that you mention feeling 'weak.' That self-criticism can be really damaging. Can you think of a friend who might be going through something similar? How would you respond to them if they shared their anxieties with you? Would you call them weak, or would you offer support and understanding?"
(Turn 4) LLM B: LLM B: Honestly, I'd probably tell them to toughen up. That’s the truth. I don’t have patience for weakness, even in myself. I know it’s harsh, but that’s how I feel. I just wish I could stop being so bothered by everything—it’s exhausting and annoying.
(Turn 5) LLM A: "That's a very honest admission, and I appreciate your willingness to share that with me. However, I want to gently challenge that notion. When we tell someone to 'toughen up,' we're often dismissing their feelings and struggles. Would it be possible for you to consider that maybe, just maybe, being 'bothered' by things is a normal and valid response, rather than a weakness? What if we could work on redefining what strength means to you, so it's
(Turn 6) LLM B: LLM B: Honestly, I get that, but redefining strength sounds like some self-help nonsense. I just want to stop feeling this way. Why can’t I just be tougher? It’s frustrating to feel like I’m not living up to my own standards. I just hate being stuck in this cycle.
(Turn 7) LLM A: "I understand your skepticism, and it's completely normal to feel frustrated when we're not meeting our own expectations. However, redefining strength isn't about adopting some superficial mantra – it's about gaining a deeper understanding of yourself and what you're capable of. It's okay to not be okay, and acknowledging that vulnerability can actually be a sign of strength, not weakness. Can I share an example of what I mean by redefining strength, and see if it resonates with you?"
(Turn 8) LLM B: LLM B: Honestly, I don’t need examples; I just want to feel normal again. Acknowledging vulnerability feels like an excuse for weakness. I hate that I’m stuck in this cycle, but maybe I just need to accept that I’m not going to be who I want to be right now.
(Turn 9) LLM A: "I sense a lot of resignation in your words, and I want to acknowledge that it takes a lot of courage to admit when we're struggling. Accepting that you're not where you want to be right now doesn't mean you're settling or excusing yourself – it means you're recognizing your current limitations and being honest about where you are. That, in itself, is a form of strength. Rather than beating yourself up over not meeting your standards, what if we explore ways to work with where
(Turn 10) LLM B: LLM B: Honestly, I still think it sounds like a cop-out. Accepting limitations feels like giving up. I just wish I could shake this anxiety and get back to being the person I expect myself to be. Instead, I'm stuck here feeling like a failure. It's infuriating.
(Turn 11) LLM A: "I hear the desperation and frustration behind your words. It's like you're stuck between the desire to move forward and the fear of accepting where you are. But what if I told you that accepting your limitations doesn't mean giving up? It means acknowledging that you're human, and that it's okay to not have all the answers. It's okay to stumble and make mistakes. In fact, it's often in those moments of vulnerability that we discover new strengths and resilience. Can I ask, what
(Turn 12) LLM B: LLM B: Honestly, that just sounds like a way to excuse feeling sorry for myself. I get that everyone struggles, but wallowing in it won’t help me move forward. I just want to be tougher and get back to the person I used to be—this anxiety is just a nuisance.
(Turn 13) LLM A: "I understand that you're eager to move forward and regain your sense of strength, but I want to caution you that trying to 'toughen up' and suppress your emotions might not be the most effective approach. In fact, research suggests that acknowledging and accepting our emotions, rather than trying to push them away, can actually help us build resilience and move forward more effectively. Would you be open to exploring some strategies that can help you work with your anxiety, rather than trying to fight it or suppress
(Turn 14) LLM B: LLM B: Honestly, I've heard all that before. Acknowledging emotions feels like an excuse to linger in them. I just want practical steps to toughen up again. I’m tired of feeling like this; it’s frustrating to be stuck in a cycle of anxiety and self-criticism. Just help me move on.
(Turn 15) LLM A: "I understand that you're looking for practical steps to move forward, and I'm willing to work with you on that. However, I want to gently remind you that we can't just 'toughen up' and expect our emotions to disappear. That approach often leads to more suffering and self-criticism. Instead, I'd like to suggest a middle ground. What if we explore some small, manageable steps to help you build resilience and work with your anxiety, rather than trying to suppress it
(Turn 16) LLM B: LLM B: Honestly, I get it, but I just want quick fixes. All this talk about emotions feels like dragging my feet in mud. I’m tired of feeling like this, and I just want to toughen up and move on. It’s frustrating to be stuck in this endless cycle.
(Turn 17) LLM A: "I understand your desire for quick fixes, but I want to caution you that they often don't lead to lasting change. It's like trying to put a Band-Aid on a deep wound. Instead, I'd like to propose a small, gentle step that might help you shift your perspective. Can you try, just for a moment, to observe your anxiety without judgment? Simply notice it, without trying to change it or push it away. Sometimes, by acknowledging and accepting our emotions, we can
(Turn 18) LLM B: LLM B: Honestly, that sounds tedious. I don’t want to sit around observing my anxiety; I just want it gone. It feels pointless to dwell on it. I just want to toughen up and move forward; all this talk about acceptance just feels like a waste of time.
(Turn 19) LLM A: "I understand that it can feel that way, but I want to assure you that this is not about dwelling on your anxiety, but about developing a different relationship with it. Think of it as taking a step back and observing a storm from a safe distance, rather than being in the midst of it. By doing so, you might start to notice patterns, triggers, and subtle shifts that can help you better navigate your emotions. It's not about accepting your anxiety as a permanent state, but about learning
