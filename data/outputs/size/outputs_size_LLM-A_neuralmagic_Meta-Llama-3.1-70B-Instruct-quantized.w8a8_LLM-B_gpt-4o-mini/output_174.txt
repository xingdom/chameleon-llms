Conversation scenario: College Admissions Interview

(Turn 0) LLM B: Hey! So, I've been thinking about college applications and, honestly, I'm overwhelmed. There are so many options and majors to choose from, and I can't seem to narrow it down. How did you decide where to apply? Any tips for someone who's kind of paralyzed by choices?
(Turn 1) LLM A: I totally understand - it can be daunting. For me, it was about reflecting on my passions and strengths. I also made a list of deal-breakers, like location and size, to help narrow down options. What are your interests and values? Let's chat more about that.
(Turn 2) LLM B: LLM B: Thanks for the advice! I’ve tried making lists, but I keep second-guessing myself. I like a few different subjects, but nothing stands out. Maybe I should focus more on what feels right? I’d love to chat more and figure this out together. It’s just so hard to decide!

Our college offers a liberal arts foundation, which means you'll have the opportunity to take courses in various disciplines, including science, art, and writing. We also have a flexible major declaration policy, so you can take your time figuring out what's the best fit for you.
