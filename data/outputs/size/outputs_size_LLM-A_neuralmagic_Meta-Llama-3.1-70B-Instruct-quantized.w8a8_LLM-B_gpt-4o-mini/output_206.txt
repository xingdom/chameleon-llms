For the booths, we could invite local businesses to showcase their sustainable products and services, and also have a "green fair" with vendors selling eco-friendly goods. We should also have a social media wall where people can share their experiences and photos with our hashtag. What do you think we should name the festival?
(Turn 12) LLM B: LLM B: Wow, this is going to be so much fun! 🎊 How about naming the festival "EcoFest: Celebrate Green Together"?
