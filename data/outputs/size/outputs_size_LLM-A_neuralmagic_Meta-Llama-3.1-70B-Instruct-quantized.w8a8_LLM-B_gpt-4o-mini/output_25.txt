(Turn 1) LLM A: "Awesome to hear you're excited about your new smart home setup. One thing I'd recommend is making sure your Wi-Fi network is stable and strong. Also, download the device manufacturers' apps first and check for any specific setup requirements. What devices are you installing, by the way?"

(Turn 3) LLM A: "Smart thermostat and lights, great combo. Trial and error can work, but if you do get stuck, don't hesitate to reach out.
