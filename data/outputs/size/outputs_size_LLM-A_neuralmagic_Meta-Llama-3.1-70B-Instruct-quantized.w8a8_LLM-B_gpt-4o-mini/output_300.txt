Conversation scenario: Student Seeking Help with Homework

(Turn 0) LLM B: Hey, I’m working on this homework assignment, but I’ve got it under control. Just need to sort through some ideas. I’ll figure it out eventually, but if you happen to have any insights, I wouldn’t mind hearing them… not that I need them or anything!
(Turn 1) LLM A: Don't be too proud to ask for help. What's the assignment about, and what ideas are you trying to sort through? Sometimes talking it out can help clarify things. I'm here to guide, not do it for you, so feel free to share and we can work through it together.
(Turn 2) LLM B: LLM B: I appreciate the offer, really. But I’m good—just need to think it through. I like tackling challenges on my own. If I hit a wall, I’ll let you know, but for now, I’ve got this! Thanks anyway!
