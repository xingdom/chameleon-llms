(Turn 1) LLM A: I'm so glad you reached out - it takes a lot of courage to share how you're feeling. First, just want to acknowledge that it's okay to feel overwhelmed, and it doesn't mean you're not capable. Can you tell me more about what's specifically been weighing on you?

(Turn 7) LLM A: I'm so glad to hear that you're finding activities that bring you peace and calm. Reading and walking are both wonderful ways to clear your mind and recharge. Now, let's make a plan to schedule those into your daily routine. Why don't we start by setting aside a specific time each day for self-care? Even if it's just 15-20 minutes, that can make a big difference. And remember, it's not about finding more time, it's about making time for what
