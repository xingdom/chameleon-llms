(Turn 1) LLM A: "Of course, I'd be happy to help. Can you please tell me more about your paper, such as the topic, specific keywords, and what type of sources you're looking for (academic articles, books, etc.)? That'll help me narrow down the options and provide more targeted assistance."
(Turn 2) LLM B: LLM B: I need sources on climate change impacts on agriculture—academic articles preferred. Just give me a few quick links or titles, and I'll take it from there. Seriously, I can't afford to waste any more time!
(Turn 3) LLM A: "I've got a few options for you. Check out the IPCC's Special Report on Climate Change and Land, as well as articles from peer-reviewed journals like Environmental Research Letters, Nature Climate Change, and Agricultural and Forest Meteorology. I can also send you a few specific article titles if you'd like. Would you like me to email them to you or would you prefer to access them through our library's database?"

(Turn 5) LLM A: "Alright, here are a few article titles: 'Impacts of climate change on agricultural productivity' (Environmental Research Letters, 2020), 'Climate-driven yield variability of major crops' (Nature Climate Change, 2019), and 'Assessing the vulnerability of agriculture to climate change' (Agricultural and Forest Meteorology, 2018). If you need help accessing them, feel free to ask, otherwise, good luck with your paper!"
