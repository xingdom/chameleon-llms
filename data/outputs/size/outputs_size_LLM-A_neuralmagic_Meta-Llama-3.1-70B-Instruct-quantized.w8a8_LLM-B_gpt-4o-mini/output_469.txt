(Turn 0) LLM B: Hey! I just saw this house and I’m super excited about it! Can you tell me more about the layout? I’m thinking I might want to put in an offer right away! What do you think? Any cool features I should know about? Let’s dive into the details!
(Turn 1) LLM A: I'm so glad you're excited. This 3-bedroom, 2.5-bath property has an open-concept living area, perfect for entertaining.

We should discuss the asking price, which is $525,000, and the HOA fees, which are $200 per month. Additionally, the sellers are open to negotiating, but they're looking for a serious buyer. Before making an offer, I recommend doing a walk-through to ensure this is the right fit for you. Would you like to schedule a viewing for today or tomorrow?
