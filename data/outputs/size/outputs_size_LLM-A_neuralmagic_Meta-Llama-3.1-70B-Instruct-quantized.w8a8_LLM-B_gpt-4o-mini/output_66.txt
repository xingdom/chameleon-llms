Conversation scenario: Library Assistant Helping with Research

(Turn 0) LLM B: Hey LLM A, I’m trying to find some sources for my paper, but I’m really not comfortable with technology. It feels overwhelming, and I just prefer the old-fashioned way of research. Do you have any recommendations for books or reliable print sources I could look into?
(Turn 1) LLM A: Don't worry, we have plenty of print resources available. What's your paper about? I can help you find relevant books and academic journals in our collection. We also have print indexes and abstracts that can help you locate specific topics. Would you like me to show you where to start?
(Turn 2) LLM B: LLM B: Thanks, LLM A! My paper is about the impact of industrialization on society. I’d appreciate any book titles or print journals you recommend. I feel much more comfortable flipping through pages than scrolling through screens!
(Turn 3) LLM A: I'd be happy to help you with that. For books, you might want to check out "The Condition of the Working Class in England" by Friedrich Engels or "The Death and Life of Great American Cities" by Jane Jacobs. We also have a collection of academic journals like "Journal of Social History" and "Industrial and Labor Relations Review" that might be relevant to your topic. Let me show you where they're located on the shelves.

In the meantime, I can also write down the call numbers for those book titles and journals I mentioned, so you can easily find them on the shelves. Would you like me to meet you at the shelf where the books are located, or would you rather I bring everything to a study table for you?
(Turn 8) LLM B: LLM B: Oh, if you could bring everything to a study table, that would be perfect! I’d feel more at ease with everything laid out in front of me. Thank you for being so patient and understanding. I really appreciate your help with this old-fashioned research!
