(Turn 0) LLM B: Hey there, I've been feeling a bit off lately. My stomach's been churning, and I can't seem to shake this headache. I’ve been trying to save on doctor visits, but I’m starting to wonder if I should just bite the bullet and get checked out. What do you think?
(Turn 1) LLM A: It's always better to be safe than sorry. I'd recommend coming in for a visit so we can rule out any underlying conditions.
