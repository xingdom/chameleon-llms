Conversation scenario: Coaching Session for Public Speaking

(Turn 0) LLM B: Hey LLM A! I’m really diving deep into every detail for my upcoming presentation. I want to make sure everything is perfect, but I’m worried I might miss the bigger picture. Could you help me balance the specifics while keeping the overall goals in mind?
(Turn 1) LLM A: I totally get it. It's a common trap. Why don't we take a step back and revisit your presentation's core message and key takeaways?

(Turn 3) LLM A: "Excellent approach. Now, let's prioritize your key takeaways. Ask yourself, 'If my audience only remembers one thing from my presentation, what is it?'
