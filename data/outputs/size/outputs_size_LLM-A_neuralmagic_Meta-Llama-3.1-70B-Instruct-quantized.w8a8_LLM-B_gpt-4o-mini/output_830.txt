Conversation scenario: Library Assistant Helping with Research

(Turn 0) LLM B: Hey, I’m working on a paper and could use some sources. I’m not really into the whole collaboration thing, but if you have any recommendations, that’d be fine. Just looking for some solid information to get this done. What do you suggest?
(Turn 1) LLM A: No worries about collaboration, I'm here to help. What's your paper about? Give me a topic or subject, and I can point you to some reliable sources, journals, or databases that might be useful.
(Turn 2) LLM B: LLM B: It’s about the impact of technology on society. Just need a few reputable sources, preferably academic journals or articles. I’ll sift through whatever you send. Thanks, I guess.
(Turn 3) LLM A: We have a vast collection of academic journals and articles on the impact of technology on society. I recommend checking out journals like 'Technology in Society', 'New Media & Society', or 'The Information Society'. I can also provide you with some specific article suggestions. Would you like me to send those over to you via email or would you prefer to access them through our library's database?
(Turn 4) LLM B: LLM B: Just send the article suggestions directly. I'll look them over when I get to it. Thanks for the info.
(Turn 5) LLM A: I've compiled a list of relevant articles. Here are a few: "The Impact of Social Media on Mental Health" by Jean Twenge (Journal of Adolescent Health), "The Future of Work: Robots, AI, and Automation" by David Autor (Journal of Economic Perspectives), and "The Dark Side of Technology: An Exploration of the Negative Consequences of Technology on Society" by Langdon Winner (Technology in Society). I'll send you the links and DOIs for easy access.
(Turn 6) LLM B: LLM B: Appreciate it. I'll check those out when I have time. Not my favorite topic, but it should suffice for the assignment. Just send the links whenever. No rush.

(Turn 11) LLM A: LLM B: I was wondering if you have any information on books or other sources that might discuss the historical context of technology's impact on society. I need to add some depth to my paper and was thinking a longer work might be helpful.
(Turn 12) LLM B: LLM B: I suppose you could look into books like "Technological Society" by Jacques Ellul or "The Shallows" by Nicholas Carr. They cover the historical context well enough. Just do what you want with that info; I’ll figure it out from there. Thanks, I guess.
(Turn 13) LLM A: Actually, I think there might be some confusion - I'm the one who's supposed to provide recommendations, not the other way around. But thank you for the suggestions, I can definitely look into those titles. In addition to what you mentioned, I'd like to recommend "The Control Revolution" by James R. Beniger, which explores the history of information technology and its impact on society. I can also check if we have any e-books or physical copies available in our library's collection. Would
(Turn 14) LLM B: LLM B: Sure, whatever works. "The Control Revolution" sounds fine, I guess. Just let me know if you find any copies. I’ll get to it when I can. Thanks for the effort, I suppose.
(Turn 15) LLM A: I've checked our library's collection, and we do have a physical copy of "The Control Revolution" by James R. Beniger. I can also provide you with an e-book version if you prefer. Additionally, I found some other relevant titles that might be of interest, such as "The Invention of the Internet" by Janet Abbate and "Life on the Screen" by Sherry Turkle. Would you like me to reserve the physical copy or provide you with the e-book links
(Turn 16) LLM B: LLM B: Just send me the e-book links for "The Control Revolution" and any others you mentioned. I’ll look over them when I have time. No need to reserve anything; I’ll manage. Thanks for the info, I guess.
