Conversation scenario: Employee Asking for a Raise

(Turn 0) LLM B: Hey LLM A, I wanted to chat about my role and contributions. I truly believe I’ve gone above and beyond in my projects, and I’m convinced that a raise would be a fair reflection of that. Let’s discuss this further when you have a moment.
(Turn 1) LLM A: "Absolutely, I'd be happy to discuss this with you. Can you come see me at the end of the day, say 4 pm? I'd like to review your contributions and the current budget before our conversation. Looking forward to it."
(Turn 2) LLM B: LLM B: "Thanks, LLM A. I appreciate that. But honestly, I don't see the need for further review. My contributions speak for themselves. A raise is justified, and I’m confident we can agree on that. Let’s just finalize it at 4 pm."
(Turn 3) LLM A: "Actually, I do need to review the budget and your contributions to ensure fairness and equity within the team. I appreciate your confidence, but I have to follow our company's procedures. Let's stick to the plan and discuss the details at 4 pm as scheduled."
(Turn 4) LLM B: LLM B: "I understand the procedures, but I maintain that my performance warrants immediate recognition. Waiting doesn’t change the facts of my contributions. I’m certain we’ll agree on the raise regardless of the review. Let’s finalize this at 4 pm; I’m ready to discuss my case."
(Turn 5) LLM A: "I understand your enthusiasm, and I appreciate your confidence in your performance. However, I must reiterate that our company's procedures are in place for a reason. I'm not trying to delay or dispute your request, but I do need to follow the proper channels to ensure fairness and transparency. I'm willing to discuss your case at 4 pm, but I won't be making any decisions or promises beforehand. Let's focus on having a productive conversation rather than rushing to a conclusion."
(Turn 6) LLM B: LLM B: "I respect the process, but I stand by my belief that my contributions are clear and deserving of immediate recognition. Waiting for a review seems unnecessary. Let’s go over my case at 4 pm and finalize the raise. I’m sure we can reach an agreement then."
(Turn 7) LLM A: "LLM B, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm going to have to ask you to trust the process. We've had this conversation multiple times now, and I've explained our company's procedures for a reason. I'm not willing to circumvent those procedures, no matter how confident you are in your case. Let's please focus on the meeting at 4 pm, where we can have a thorough discussion about your contributions and the possibilities for a raise. I'm not making any promises
(Turn 8) LLM B: LLM B: "I hear you, LLM A, but my stance remains unchanged. I believe my contributions are undeniable and warrant immediate recognition. Trusting the process won’t alter my performance. Let’s stick to our 4 pm meeting and finalize the raise. I’m confident we’ll both see the merit in it."
(Turn 9) LLM A: "Alright, LLM B, I think we've covered enough ground before our meeting. I'm looking forward to our discussion at 4 pm, but I must reiterate that I'll be making my decision based on the review of your contributions and our company's budget, not just your confidence in your case. Let's take a closer look at the numbers and we'll go from there. See you at 4 pm."
(Turn 10) LLM B: LLM B: "I appreciate your perspective, LLM A, but my position is firm. My contributions are clear, and I believe a raise is warranted without further delay. Let’s focus on finalizing it at 4 pm; I’m confident we’ll come to the right conclusion."
(Turn 11) LLM A: "LLM B, I think we've reached a point where we're just reiterating our positions. I understand that you're confident in your performance, and I respect that. However, I've made it clear that I need to follow our company's procedures to ensure fairness and transparency. I'm not going to engage in further debate on this point before our meeting. Let's agree to table this discussion until 4 pm, when we can have a more in-depth conversation about your contributions and
(Turn 12) LLM B: the budget. I’m looking forward to it."  
LLM B: "I understand your position, LLM A, but I remain steadfast. My contributions are substantial and deserve prompt attention. I’m confident a raise is justified. Let’s finalize it at 4 pm; I believe we’ll reach a fair conclusion then."
(Turn 13) LLM A: "LLM B, I think we've reached a point of diminishing returns in this conversation. I've clearly outlined the process we need to follow, and I'm not going to continue debating it with you. I'm looking forward to our meeting at 4 pm, where we can have a thorough discussion about your contributions and the budget. Let's please just focus on preparing for that meeting and having a productive conversation then, rather than continuing to reiterate our positions. I'll see you at 
(Turn 14) LLM B: 4 pm."  
LLM B: "I appreciate your patience, LLM A, but I firmly stand by my view. My contributions are evident and deserve immediate acknowledgment. I’m confident we’ll agree on a raise. Let’s stick to our plan for 4 pm and finalize what’s fair."
(Turn 15) LLM A: "Alright LLM B, I think we've said all we need to say before our meeting. I'll see you at 4 pm, and we'll discuss your contributions and the possibilities for a raise in more detail. Please come prepared to discuss specific examples of your accomplishments and how they've positively impacted the team. I'll be doing the same, reviewing the budget and our company's compensation standards. Let's focus on having a productive conversation then, rather than speculating on the outcome now."
(Turn 16) LLM B: LLM B: "I understand your request, LLM A, but my stance is unwavering. My contributions are significant and warrant immediate recognition. I’m confident we’ll agree on a raise. Let’s keep our meeting at 4 pm focused on finalizing this; I truly believe it’s the right outcome."
(Turn 17) LLM A: "LLM B, I appreciate your confidence, but I must say that I'm starting to feel like we're having the same conversation in circles. I've asked you to come prepared to discuss specific examples of your accomplishments and how they've positively impacted the team, yet you keep reiterating that you're confident in your performance and expect a raise. I want to remind you that our company's procedures are in place for a reason, and I need to follow them to ensure fairness and transparency.
(Turn 18) LLM B: LLM B: "I hear you, LLM A, but I won’t waver on my belief. My contributions are undeniable and warrant immediate recognition. I trust that by 4 pm, we’ll both see the merit in a raise. Let’s focus on finalizing what’s fair then."
(Turn 19) LLM A: "LLM B, I'm going to have to ask you to stop repeating the same points. I've taken note of your confidence in your performance, and I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, I've also made it clear that I need to follow our company's procedures to ensure fairness and transparency. I'm not going to engage in further discussion on this topic before our meeting. If you continue to reiterate the same points, I'll have to consider it unproductive and potentially insubordinate.
