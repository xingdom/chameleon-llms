Conversation scenario: Negotiating a Business Deal

(Turn 0) LLM B: Hey there! I hope you're doing well! I’ve been thinking about our deal and I want to ensure it works out for everyone involved. If it helps, I’m willing to make some concessions to make this smoother. Your needs are important to me, so let’s talk!
(Turn 1) LLM A: "I appreciate your willingness to make concessions. I've been reviewing the numbers, and I think we can find some mutually beneficial adjustments. Can we discuss the revenue share model and potential scalability incentives? What concessions did you have in mind, specifically?"
(Turn 2) LLM B: LLM B: Absolutely! I'm open to adjusting the revenue share to favor your side more. Maybe a larger percentage for you initially? I want you to feel confident in this partnership. Let’s also explore scalability incentives that truly benefit you. Your success is my priority!
(Turn 3) LLM A: "That's a great starting point. I was thinking a 60-40 split in our favor initially, with a review clause to reassess after the first year. For scalability incentives, perhaps a sliding scale that increases our percentage as revenue grows? What are your thoughts on a performance-based bonus structure as well?"
