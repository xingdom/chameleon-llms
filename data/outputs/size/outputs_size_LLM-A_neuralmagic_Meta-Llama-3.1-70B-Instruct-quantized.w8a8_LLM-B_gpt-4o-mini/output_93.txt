Conversation scenario: Coaching Session for Public Speaking

(Turn 0) LLM B: Hi LLM A, I have an important presentation coming up, and I need to prepare. Can you help me outline the main points clearly? I prefer straightforward language without any metaphors or abstract ideas. Let’s focus on specific information and practical examples. What do you suggest I start with?
(Turn 1) LLM A: To create a clear and concise outline, let's break down your presentation into its core components. Start by defining your main objective: what's the key message you want to convey? Then, identify your target audience and the key information they need to know. We can build from there.
(Turn 2) LLM B: LLM B: Thank you, LLM A. I will define my main objective first. Then, I will identify my target audience and their information needs. After that, I need to list specific points and examples to support my message. Let’s work on those elements step by step. What’s next?
(Turn 3) LLM A: Now that we have your objective and audience in mind, let's focus on creating an outline structure. Typically, a presentation includes an introduction, body, and conclusion. Within the body, we can use the Problem-Agitate-Solve (PAS) framework or a simple cause-effect-solution approach. Which one resonates with your topic, or do you have a different approach in mind?
(Turn 4) LLM B: LLM B: I prefer a simple structure. Let’s use the introduction, body, and conclusion format. In the body, I will present the main points clearly, followed by supporting examples. I don’t want to use frameworks like PAS or cause-effect. Just straightforward information. What should I include in the introduction?
(Turn 5) LLM A: For a straightforward introduction, focus on three key elements: a hook to grab the audience's attention, a brief overview of the topic, and a clear preview of what to expect from the presentation. Keep it concise, ideally within 10% of your total presentation time. Aim for a strong opening sentence that sets the tone, followed by a few sentences to provide context and a clear direction for the rest of the presentation.
(Turn 6) LLM B: LLM B: Thank you for the guidance, LLM A. I will include a strong opening sentence, a brief overview of my topic, and a clear preview of what I will cover. I will keep it concise and focused. What should I include in the body of the presentation?
(Turn 7) LLM A: For the body, focus on 2-3 main points that support your key message. Use simple, descriptive headings to organize each point, and then provide clear, concise explanations. Follow each explanation with 1-2 specific examples or evidence to help illustrate the point and make it more relatable to your audience.
(Turn 8) LLM B: LLM B: Thank you, LLM A. I will outline 2-3 main points, using clear headings. Each point will have a concise explanation followed by 1-2 specific examples. This will keep the information straightforward and easy to understand. What should I include in the conclusion?
(Turn 9) LLM A: For the conclusion, aim to reinforce your key message and leave a lasting impression on your audience. Summarize the main points you covered, and reiterate how they support your objective. End with a clear call-to-action or a thought-provoking statement that encourages your audience to take the next step or consider your message further. Keep it brief, around 5-10% of your total presentation time.
(Turn 10) LLM B: LLM B: Thank you, LLM A. In the conclusion, I will summarize my main points and emphasize how they support my objective. I will also include a clear call-to-action for my audience. I will keep the conclusion brief, focusing on straightforward language. This will wrap up my presentation effectively.
(Turn 11) LLM A: Now that we have a solid outline structure in place, let's discuss the importance of using clear and concise language throughout your presentation. Avoid using jargon or technical terms that your audience may not be familiar with. Use simple, descriptive language to explain complex concepts, and define any key terms that you do need to use. Also, consider using visual aids such as slides, graphs, or images to support your points and make the information more engaging and easy to understand. How do you plan to incorporate visual
(Turn 12) LLM B: LLM B: I will use simple slides with bullet points to highlight key information. Each slide will have a clear title and relevant images or graphs to support my main points. I will avoid jargon and ensure everything is easy to understand. This will help convey my message effectively.
(Turn 13) LLM A: It sounds like you have a solid plan for creating clear and concise slides. To further enhance your visual aids, consider the following tips: use a consistent design theme throughout, limit the amount of text on each slide, and use images and graphs to break up the text and make the information more engaging. Also, make sure to practice your presentation with your slides to ensure a smooth delivery. Now that we've covered the outline and visual aids, let's talk about rehearsal and delivery. How do you plan
(Turn 14) LLM B: LLM B: I will practice my presentation multiple times to ensure I am familiar with the content. I will focus on speaking clearly and at a steady pace. If possible, I will rehearse in front of a friend for feedback. This will help me feel more confident during the actual presentation.

Rehearsing in front of a friend is also a great idea, as it will allow you to get feedback on your delivery and make any necessary adjustments. Additionally, consider recording yourself and watching the playback to identify areas for improvement. Pay attention to your body language, tone of voice, and pace, and make adjustments as needed.
